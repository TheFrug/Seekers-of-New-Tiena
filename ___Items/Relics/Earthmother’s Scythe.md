Relic of [[Chauntea]], the Earthmother. The Earthmother’s scythe is a limber scythe with a wooden handle, a dull blade, and a beautiful rose at his head. 

The true relic is currently in the possession of [[Baron Clungunford Rose]], but a [[False Earthmother’s Scythe|Replica]] of diminished power sits in [[Pastor Edith]]’s office in the [[Church of Chauntea]].

 - A relic of Chauntea, the Earthmother, goddess of life, bounty, and agriculture. The Earthmother’s Scythe is a limber, smooth-wooden scythe with a rose crest at its head. It can be used to perform incredible feats of nature magic in proportion to the strength of the user, especially so in the hands of a druid. It can consecrate land, enriching its soil, or even cut open a portal to a faraway land that celebrates Chauntea as well.
