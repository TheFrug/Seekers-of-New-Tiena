## Merric's Trial

The entire session will be the players gathering testimony for the trial of Merric, which will take place shortly before sunset. Before then, the players are encouraged to fulfill quests

Merric will either be exiled, or he will be freed. There is a chance if he is freed that the Firbolgs will require that he undergo treatment for his lycanthropy, which the party can weigh in on.

Plaintiffs: [[Walter 'The Whip' Wadsworth|The Whip]], [[Baron Clungunford Rose|Clungunford]], Clungunford's Boy, concerned townsfolk
Defendants: [[Pastor Edith]] (now missing), The Party


## Church of Chauntea Wreckage

### Scene Goals
- Communicate the devastating attack of last night's attack
- Set up Merric's trial, the stakes, and what the party has to do to influence it
- Establish the distrust in Merric among even the orphan children
- Reveal the fear among townsfolk about the scythe being missing

### READ ALOUD

As you approach the center of town, an unusual scent wafts into your nose, a mix of musty decay and a powerful floral fragrance. As you crest over the last hill before the town square, you can see the [[Church of Chauntea]], now roofless, with a steady stream of traffic in and out as a pile of slumped grey heaped just outside the front garden grows larger.

Passing through the large doors of the church, the party now sees the beautiful stained-glass mural of Chauntea shining over the the wreckage they fought in the night prior: the pews many disorderly, many still unseen, buried under the collapsed ceiling. Children of many ages quietly pick up what little wilted wood they can in their small hands, as they join the brown-cloaked adults in loading heaps onto a wagon to add to the pile outside.

*Ask the party how they feel*



### Key Details
- **Location:** [[Church of Chauntea]]
- **Time of Day**: Morning-Midday
- **Mood/Atmosphere:** Tragic, shocked, that terrifying quiet kind of rage southerners have sometimes

### Secrets & Clues
- Pastor Edith kept a prayer journal. Her recent entries are beaming with pride in Merric. There are also many confessions of doubt in her nephew Clungunford Rose's plan, mentioning the Scythe.
- Cultists of Talona have the ability to resurrect after death.

### NPCs Involved

- **Church Orphans:** Cleaning/playing in the wreckage is the dozen or so orphans that live in the [[Church of Chauntea]]. While some still act like kids despite everything, some of them are worried about [[Pastor Edith]] being missing.
	- Role: Neutral
	- Motivation: They're kids! They want to have fun, but all this tension is making things hard.
	- Purpose:
		- Players can convince kids to testify if they can keep their attention
		- Kids might get hurt by Risen Cultists
	- Secret/Challenge: The kids are afraid of [[Fiona]], the newest and oldest orphan girl. She works as an apprentice for [[Bevin Gladstar]].
- **[[Vernon]]:** An older Firbolg devout who sits on one of the cleaned pews and contemplates. Whether he likes it or not, he takes more of a "sit and rest" role, as the oldest kids and many adults don't allow him to get up to help.
	- Appearance: Overalls with flowers lovingly embroidered onto them by children, has a peg leg assisted by crooked, near-broken cane.
	- Role: Neutral, kind
	- Motivation: Hopefully make some sense of all this, or at least come to accept it.
	- Purpose: 
		- Convey how screwed Merric is if he doesn't get good testimony
	- Secret/Challenge: The children of the Church find Vernon unbelievably cool for no discernable reason. He has yet to realize this, nor that half the kids want him to adopt them. 

### Encounters / Challenges

- Two children (ages 8-11), a Firbolg and a halfling, get into a fight over [[Brother Merric]]'s absence. Things cross the line into a physical altercation when the Firbolg boy says that Merric betrayed Edith's kindness, and that he must have never appreciated her to begin with. This leads the Halfling boy to jump onto the Firbolg
	- The Firbolg child asserts that Merric was responsible for the Church being ruined, citing Merric get dragged into the smokehouse and Pastor Edith being missing. 
	- The halfling child is emphatic that Merric is innocent, and seems almost panicked at Merric's detainment.
- After a few rounds, they stir a pile of detritus near the back wall of the Church, and a zombified Cultist bursts out to attack.
	- Players roll initiative and narrate their response. Its one zombie so there isn't much harm to the players.

- **Mood/Atmosphere:** Jovial, trusting, concerned

### Secrets & Clues
- Brenwin is a prince from a far away Desert land called [[Al Qonidar]]

## Herbalist Shop

### Scene Goals
- Help Malachi cure his [[Effluvia Bloom]]
- Teach Malachi how he can cure his wererat lycanthropy
- Introduce [[Bevin Gladstar]], and by extension the story of [[Airmed]], a benevolent Seelie fey
- Establish that the [[Cult of Talona]] has been a cause of strife in the region for decades, but hasnâ€™t been stopped

### READ ALOUD
At the end of a row of small shophouses, there is one built out of a gnarled tree stump with a bend so strong it almost looks like an 'L'. Dangling from the bent part is a large sign that reads [[Gladstar Balms]], and the door is only 6 ft tall.

Inside, 

[[Bevin Gladstar]] is a [[Firbolg]] who has more devotion to a different spirit of agriculture ([[Airmed]])than [[Chauntea]], who is revealed to be her patron, a Fey named Airmed who spent her life helping mortals with medicine for her tricks. She might know of a cure for Malachi's lycanthropy, but they will have to find it in a dangerous creature's nest.
 
### Secrets & Clues

- [[Bevin Gladstar]] knows about Merric because Pastor Edith brought Merric to Bevin to ask if they could cure him, but Merric never went through with the treatment, as he likes being a Wererat
- [[Bevin Gladstar]] had a [[Fey]] friend named [[Airmed]], a beautiful [[Seelie Court|Seelie]] pixie who devoted her life to herbalism, learning the medicinal and poisoning properties of 365 different herbs across [[Tiena]]. She became Bevin Gladstar's patron on a whim, and while Bevin has been provided the powers of a low-level warlock, they have lost touch with these since Airmed became impossible to reach.
- The reason Bevin's garden is not doing well is because they are one of the citizens of Bromzheath targeted by [[Baron Clungunford Rose]]'s selective use of the [[Earthmother's Scythe]]. The Rose family conspired to ruin their herbology shop because of A. its connection to the Fey and B. because the more effective it became, the less that the people of Bromzheath would have need for the [[Church of Chauntea]]'s magic. This is all what Bevin suspects, although they have no proof.
- Merric's compost farm has been helpful to [[Bevin Gladstar]]'s garden ever since Clungunford stopped consecrating it. This might help the players convince them to testify.

### NPCs

- [[Bevin Gladstar]]: A Firbolg woman with fey markings and tattoos across her hands and face, although her face is partially obscured by a mysterious shroud. Bevin is gruff, and has been in a slump since their herb garden stopped developing as they wish. 
- [[Fiona]], Firbolg teen girl who has a bit of a 'ttude. She is an orphan who lives at the Church after her parents contracted the same disease that killed their crops. Fiona accidentally worsened her parents condition with a bad remedy before taking them to Bevin. Since then, Fiona has been learning from Bevin since, seeking to atone for what she sees as the murder of her parents.


### Encounters / Challenges
- The cure for [[Malachi]]'s [[Effluvia Bloom]] is a potion that [[Bevin Gladstar]] can make, but requires a mushroom that grows on the back of a [[shambling-mound-xmm|Shambling Mound]], which Bevin Gladstar can magically locate via divination spell [[locate-creature-xphb|Locate Creature]].
- The cure for [[Malachi]]'s lycanthropy requires the blood of his sire, [[Brother Merric]], and will likely only be successful if Merric is free after the trial

## The Holding Block

### Scene Goals
- Establish Merric's concern

### Key Details
- **Location:** The Smokehouse/ The holding block
- **Time of Day**: Early afternoon
- **Mood/Atmosphere:** Tense, kinda sad :(

### Secrets & Clues
- Merric knows the location of the [[Temple of Talona]]
- The [[Cult of Talona]] wants to use [[Pastor Edith]] for some form of nefarious magic, likely a ritual given Edith's connection to Talona's enemy [[Chauntea]]
- Merric is a vegetarian, so being inside the Smokehouse is upsetting for him!

### NPCs Involved

- **NPC Name:** [[Brother Merric]]
	- Role: Prisoner
	- Motivation: To be freed, to be forgiven by the villagers, to atone for Edith's capture
	- Purpose: Can help the party make it to the
