- **Location:** [[Littlerock Island]], [[Istalean Sea]]

- **Mission:** Discover the Corrupting Relic

- **Tier:** 1 (Level 3)

### Backstory

Only a week back, the party was hired by Captain Cardbeard, a heavyset dwarf captain wearing a black fur cape, a cardboard tricorne, and cards garnishing his beard. The mission, delivered in a booming voice over the rowdy patrons of the busy tavern, was to sail to Littlerock Island and retrieve a powerful artifact buried somewhere there. Littlerock Island, known for little other than sheep and its gemstone mine, has been the the subject of superstition recently for the stillness of its border waters, as well as the ominous fog that fills its rocky terrain. Regardless of the perils that undoubtedly await you, you board Cardbeard's ship, She Got the House, and sail a quiet voyage to Littlerock Island.


### Interest
- **Hook:** Hired by Captain Cardbeard
- **Rewards:** A share of the treasure once pawned by Captain Cardbeard
- **Perils:** Kuo-Toa cultists, Booga-Booga's digestive system.


### Secrets
**Twist:** 
- Secret 1: Captain Cardbeard has been to Littlerock Island before. In fact, his blunder here is why that big whale started mind controlling its denizens and working its tentacles around to eat stuff
- Secret 2: Grimm, the solitary orc fisherman, is one of the survivors of Cardbeard's crew. He resents Cardbeard for abandoning them in the whale cave.
- Secret 3: The Kuo-Toa Shaman leading the cult is actually a Sea Hag in disguise who has concocted a scheme to fish out this whale's belly for treasure, and plans to continue doing so, draining one island at a time.

### Setting
_Brief notes on factions, flora/fauna, mood, or key NPCs._  
(Just 3–5 bullets)

-  Littlerock Island is a grey collection of rocks. The sky is grey and there is an ominious mist that creeps around the craggy geography and around the cracks in the weak-wooden sheds the Delthuntle villagers call homes.
-  The gemstone cave is a massive, hollow structure. The air is stale, and there is a sleek black body of water that opens over 150 feet wide that leads out into the Istalean Sea

### NPCs

#### She Got the House's Crew
- Captain Cardbeard: A disgraced treasure-seeker and questionable leader, [[Captain Cardbeard]] leads the crew of his ship, "[[She Got the House]]".
- [[Jobs Steve]]: A Cleric of Neptune and the man who wears many many hats. 
- [[Cookie the Cook]]: A Kuo-Toa with a stained white apron that says "Kiss the Fish" and a big white chef hat. Cookie is a sweetheart, but still can't differentiate between fish at various stages of freshness. 

#### Delthuntle
- [[Mama Sue]]: A halfling granny who is blind, and is waiting for her son, "The Guy" to come home and help her take her medicine. She is accompanied by a sassy sheep named Molly who knows more than her non-sighted owner
- Grimm: A solitary orc fisherman, and one of the few villagers remaining.

#### Lord Booga-Booga's Belly
- Delthuntle's sailors: Drunk halflings dancing with Kuo-Toa
- Kuo-Toa Tribe: A tribe of Kuo-toa that seem to be caught between dancing with Delthuntle's halflings and carrying out their remarkably well-organized routine of sorting monster guts and shipwrecks for worthwhile scraps, and then collecting them to give to their shaman
	- Toodoomoona: Kuo-Toa Monitor that has grown suspicious of the Shaman, and could be convinced to defy her.
- Sea Hag Tiffany/Kuo-Toa Shaman: The leader of the Kuo-Toa and the highest in their cult's order. In reality, this is a Sea Hag using disguising magic to trick the Kuo-Toa into forming an efficient treasure and food system for the Sea Hag, who uses the Relic dropped by Captain Cardbeard to gain complete dominance over the whale.

### Start
_How does the session begin?_  
(e.g., "The players wake up in chains on a slave ship", "They’re summoned to a crumbling town square")

---

### Structure

#### Act I — Entrance and Guardian
**Time:** _~__ mins_  
-  Littlerock Island is eerily quiet as the party arrives. Captain Cardbeard is unwilling to leave the boat, as he is concerned about keeping a look out. He assures the party that the treasure they seek, and much more, is found in the gemstone cave on the island, and to ask the villagers about its whereabouts.
-  As they descend the plank to get off, they can discover that a halfling fisherman is being dragged away by a troop of Kuo-Toa (1 monitor, 2 Kuo-Toa Whips, and a difficult-to-separate group of 3 regular Kuo-Toa). They chatter loudly upon seeing the party, and if the party attempts to intervene, they attack. 

#### Act II — Arrival at Delthuntle
**Time:** _~__ mins_  
- After making their way to the village, the PCs must ask around about the treasure. 
- There are very few villagers for the size of the town, and the NPCs the party does find reveal that nothing about a relic, but that it might have something to do with their missing sailors and fishermen
- One of the NPCs, Grimm, an orc that used to be in Captain Cardbeard's crew, leads on that he knows of a treasure on the island, and that it likely has something to do with the missing people. He wants it gone so he can get back out on the seas
- The village's strongest folk, their sailors and young fishermen, were killed by something, likely that lives in the plot cave (tm)

#### Act III — Tummy Party
**Time:** _~__ mins_  
_Climax, twist, and resolution_  
- As the party approaches the cave, they see the gemstones 
- Inside the beast's stomach, the villagers from [[Littlerock Island]] are floating on massive rafts built from ships devoured by the massive whale. They are hosting a massive party, using the persistent heartbeat of the massive whale as the bass for a sweet halfling + Kuo-toa rave.
- The Halflings think they and the Kuo-Toa are friends, but the Kuo-Toa are using them, planning on sacrificing all the halflings in a ritual they call "Dinner"
- The fishermen fish in Booga-Booga's belly for surviving fish which the Kuo-Toa can prepare as food for themselves/Booga-Booga
- The villagers play music and dance with their captors, in part out of preservation, and in part out of madness caused by the persistent heartbeat
- There are many boats with treasure around the belly, including Cardbeard's favorite ship, and the ship that carried his treasure: Cardbeard's Ace. Aboard the Ace is parts of Cardbeard's old crew, who swear to take revenge on him if they ever get out. In the treasure room, the players can find plenty of loot, but no relic. The pirates tell them that the relic is somewhere else.

#### Act IV - The Heart
**Time:** _~1 hour_
_Climax, twist, and resolution_  
-  In Booga-Booga's heart chamber, his massive heart pounds, wailing in pain from the [[Geas of the Horned King]] embedded in it. Here, the players are either brought before the hag by force, or find her on their own.
-  Once the Geas is removed, Booga-Booga begins a three turn timer before he expels the contents of his heart onto the crystal cave outside, significantly weakening [[Sea Hag Tiffany|Tiffany]], the Sea Hag


#### Act V - Captain Bridget
**Time:** _~__ mins_  
_Climax, twist, and resolution_  
- The party leaves with the relic, and the villagers seem confused as to the relic's being there at all, wondering how it managed to get in the possession of a big whale.
- When the party leaves, all seems well, only for their ship to be beset by eldritch blasts, desecrating the body, allowing Captain Bridget to board.
- Bridget kills Kooky Captain, and threatens the rest of the party: The Captain was going to use this relic to do bad shit, so Bridget offers everyone in the party the chance to join her crew.
