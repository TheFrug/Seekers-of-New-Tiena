### Backstory
_What happened before the session starts? Summarize the catalyst or world state._  
(1-2 Sentences)

In the Thracian Peninsula, many traditions predate the [[Tragedy of Gae Bolg]] that saw the region sundered into Manster District and the Kingdom of Thracia. One of these is chaotic Orc weddings! On this day in particular, the much anticipated marriage of [[Selfina]] of Alster (Manster District) and [[Magorn]] of Kapathogia, Thracia will be commenced! This will see the first international union of lords seen since before the Tragedy, and is a historic political event. 

One of the traditions that predate the rift between the two nations is the [[Hombyld]], a ritual where the prospective Bride and Groom work for several months before the wedding to construct a house from wood, which will be the future home of the couple. This one is built atop a mountain with the Kingdom on one side, and the District on the other. With Selfina's magic, she can even see as far as Alster castle and Kapathogia palace.

### Interest
- **Hook:** A legendary wedding and the meeting of many politically significant people
- **Rewards:** Political gain, monetary reward, firsthand account of historic wedding
- **Perils:** Stated: Thracian interlopers, Goblin troublemakers, the odd wyvern, **the drama**
- **Feel:** Whimsy -> Over-the-top drama -> Emotional resolution

### Secrets
**Twist:** 
- Secret 1:  [[Magorn]], the groom and prince of Kapathogia is a big jerk and more importantly, a [[Gruumsh]] worshipper, meaning Magorn holds racist beliefs about Orc supremacy, and is especially prejudiced against Goblins. 
- Secret 2:  [[Selfina]], the bride and princess of Alster, has been having an affair with a minor lord of Thracia named [[Disler]], who happens to be a goblin
- Secret 3:  [[Disler]], the goblin in charge of the wedding sabotage, is actually the affair partner of Selfina, the bride.
- Secret 4:  [[Selfina]] is pregnant, but is unsure if the child is Magorn's

### Setting
_Brief notes on factions, flora/fauna, mood, or key NPCs._  
(Just 3–5 bullets)

-  The Pearl: A beautiful manor resting just beside the gorgeous Pearlescent Lake. Behind The Pearl is one of Manster's many enchanted forests, and across from it, over the lake, is The Splitveil Ridge, which separates Manster District and the Kingdom of Thracia
-  Wedding Venue: A tableland atop The Splitveil Ridge, overlooking Manster to the north and Thracia to the South. The venue is adorned with the clashing decorations of both cultures, from the sleek marble of Manster to the bone-carved adornments of Thracia. Standing out against the warm tones of the mountain are the purple-topped tents hanging over amusement games and other fun fare. At its center, the Hombyld
-  The Hombyld: A nearly-complete  house made from wood and stone. This is the physical monument to the marriage of Selfina and Magorn, and as such is reflective of their respective cultures. Judging from the placement of the stone and wood walls, one can even make out who from the couple worked on what parts of the house

### Start

**To You, Whose Valor or Vocation Has Caught Our Interest,**

Your reputation has reached ears in high places. A matter of delicate urgency arises near the city of **Alster**, where tensions threaten to disrupt the carefully-laid plans of esteemed houses bearing banners of both the Manster District and the Kingdom of Thracia.

You are invited (and assuredly well-compensated) to lend your skills in ensuring the success of a high-stakes event. Expect moving parts, sensitive players, and no small share of intrigue. Further details upon arrival; trust that your talents will be put to good use.

Should you accept, make your way to the distinguished bothie known as The Pearlescent by the 20th night of June. Make use of its lodgings that evening. In the morning, ask for "The Electric Lion".

For an enterprising one such as yourself, this is an opportunity not only for coin, but for influence. We hope you take this into consideration

**Read Aloud**

You four are holding on for dear life as the carriage rolls as rough and as fast as it can away from the sound of massive footsteps bellowing through the trees of this otherwise serene forest. Through the moonlit darkness, you can barely see 60 feet past the back of the cart, but you know something is coming. The driver screams something about a 'one-eyed bastard'. You hear a guttural roar:
"We might not make it ta the job interview!"

Round 1: 100 Ft away, Round 2: 60 Ft Away, Round 3: 20 Ft away 
End of Round 3, Conomor busts in and destroys the cyclops, inviting the party to go to bed and talk in the morning


In the Southern half of the Manster District, in the state of Alster, there is a beautiful lake called [[the Pearlescent]]. Its shimmering waters provide nourishment to the beautiful greenery surrounding it. 

Just West of the Pearlescent is a decadent [[Bothie]], a kind of waystation for knight-errants to rest between adventures. You three stand outside, feeling loomed over by the size of The Pearl, which stands taller and wider than any Bothie you've seen, its wooden walls accented with some kind of smooth white stone (Manster folks recognize it as marble). At the top of the Bothie is a statue of a winged Lion, the symbol of the Alster family.

This one has more rooms than any you've seen, as well as what seems to be a fully-stocked service staff of squires and trainees, mostly goblinoids, with a pair of bugbears in bowties standing watch beside the doors to the small office sequestered in a corner of the pseudo-mansion. 

Inside, you three, PLAYERNAMES, sit across from Sir [[Conomor]] of Ulster, an imposing Orc with black hair and a powerful moustache.  He stands in between his chair and the desk, eyeing the three of you analytically. Finally, he breaks the stillness of the room with: 
"So, you three are the help?"


#### Act II — Wedding Preparations - Testing the Carnival
**Time:** _~30 mins_  
**Goals:** Lighten mood, introduce the bride and groom, have fun at the carnival

##### Set the Scene: 
Finally reaching the top of the mountain, you come up to a wide tableland with the mountain ridge peaks on either side. Over your shoulder to the North, you can see the lush terraces of Manster, as well as the Pearlescent lake down below. On the other side of the tableland is the South edge, overlooking the rocky, treacherous landscape of Thracia. This is as high-up as you've ever been, and the air is cooler, sharper. 

Before you is the wedding venue, currently populated primarily by silly-looking carnies and anxious-looking royalty from both nations. Your

#### Act III — Troll Den
**Time:** _~1hr_  
Boss Battle!

##### Encounters
-  Magorn left to find and obtain a Troll Heart for one of the wedding ceremonies, as felling a dangerous beast is a part of Manster wedding traditions when one member is a Knight. A couple of Thracian dracoknights happen to know the location of one nearby, and sent Magorn and a few goblinoid helpers from Manster to retrieve it.
-  Selfina hears that Magorn hasn't returned yet and panickily asks the party to find him in the troll cave.
-  When the party arrives, they see dead goblinoids around the cave, their bodies ravaged by the troll, but Magorn is unharmed, just hiding quietly. He explains the goblins gave themselves so he could escape, and requests the party go into the cave to see if they can still retrieve what they need: the "lion's eye" (in reality, he is looking for the [[Eye of Gruumsh]], which allowed the orc god Gruumsh to view the world from his home realm)
-  Inside, the party fight a troll wearing a satchel made from animal parts. Inside, it has the fresh organs of dangerous monsters that it does battle with. Above the troll, on ledges, some of its severed limbs chuck rocks and other gear at the party to cause small damage and annoy them. 

Troll Health: 42

Limb Health: 5 Each
