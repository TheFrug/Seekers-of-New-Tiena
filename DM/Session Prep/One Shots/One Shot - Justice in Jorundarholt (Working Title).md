Required Stuff:
- Town: [[Jorundarholt]]
- Patron: Jarl [[Kolbein Ironfist]]
- Assassin: 
	- The assassin is a woman named [[Elenara Dawnstride]] and the sister of a native of the region ([[Lirael Dawnstride]]) Jorundarholt was built in. This native was caroused with by Kolbein, then left destitute with child this time last year. The assassin is under the influence of [[The Spirit of Alfheim]]


### Act I

Party meets Kolbein and learns why he's so scared. They meet Ynglinga at some point, who brings their drinks, as well as a few other NPC's, including the red-herring: [[Grimbald Ironfist]]

### Act II

Kolbein turns in for the night in the tavern, and as such asks the party to keep watch outside his room, at the main entrance, and outside the tavern. [[Grimbald Ironfist]] is tasked with defending the Kolbein's estate, and will leave the tavern.
- Based on party choice, there can be a good distraction/random encounter for each party member to get fleshed out some more.
Eventually, [[Kolbein Ironfist]] is attacked by [[Elenara Dawnstride]], who uses a paralytic poison on him, intending to enact torture on him. If the party discovers her, she will flee out the window. 
This leads to either a chase and then encounter, or a failed chase will lead to an investigation. Both lead to Act III

### Act III

Elenara will, partway through combat, revert to being a commoner, as [[The Spirit of Alfheim]] will abandon her form to avoid her being slain. From there, it might attack the party, revealing more of the nature of this incident. After that, the party can either meet back up with Kolbein, or go to Alfheim with Elenara to meet Lirael.
