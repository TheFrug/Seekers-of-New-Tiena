- [[Lucian Castemur Duskwood]]: Lucian and I have the same goal which is to put this cult behind us and be rid of it. Well I have the seperate goal of finding out more about the cult and how they were able to operate.
	- Key Moments this Session: Discovery in the lab/ratmancer's lair 
- [[Malachi]]: Understanding the new wrist warps as Malachi never has owned magical equipment. I would think he has seen/been around a ton but never owned himself.
	- Key Moments this Session: Attuning with [[Silksail]] and learning that the Sundering of [[Androticus]] was not an accident; it was caused by the Gods
- [[Calendula Serenada]]: ???
	- Key Moments this Session: Seeing [[Flint Reverie]] leading negotiations with the [[Magram Tribe]], trying to convince them to trample through [[Bromzheath]] because "That's what happens when you defy the Unseelie" + to steal the [[Earthmother's Scythe]] + kill [[Ethereal Song]] and reclaim the treasures he stole hundreds of years ago + to turn [[Bromzheath]] into more [[Feywild]]

# Outline Potential Scenes

## Discoveries in the Lab and Ratmancer's Lair

### Scene Goals
- Players explore the Lab-O-Rat-Ory of the [[Temple of Talona]] and discover the Spreadsheet
- If players access the Ratmancer's Lair, they can find a journal with frantic scrawling about the "Rosy Bull" ([[Clungunford Rose]]) and how the [[Cult of Talona]] will reclaim their lost [[Relic]]: the [[Decanter of Unending Filth]], from him no matter the cost.
- I'm sure it'll be fun either way!

### READ ALOUD

You enter through the cramped stone archway into a small laboratory. The stagnant stench of the rest of the dungeon now pales in comparison to the multifaceted, nuanced rankness of this chamber. Inside there are bubbling cauldrons with various hues of muck encrusted around the rims, body parts lying on tables with pins holding them in place, and vials of empty and full potion bottles lining the shelves on the walls. At the opposite end of the room, there is a stone statue of a Rat statue. At one table, a rat in a lab coat haunches over a collection of bubbling vials and test tubes. With a twitch, he turns towards the party with a crazed look in his eye before loading his automatic crossbow with vials. 

### Key Details
- **Location:** 
- **Time of Day**:
- **Mood/Atmosphere:**

#### NPCs Involved
- **NPC Name:** [[Dan the Lab Rat]]
	- Motivation: To finish his last experiment: to combine as many of the poisons and toxins as possible on one person and see what happens.

### Secrets & Clues
- Spreadsheet of poisons/diseases requested by various sources, including powerful families and royalty from across [[Tiena]]. Columns: Ingredients and Dosages, recipient name, craftsman's signature, date, and status of completion.
	- Notable names: 
	- [[Clungunford Rose]]
	- [[Felix Duskwood]], written in a cipher familiar to [[Lucian Castemur Duskwood]], older order
	- [[Theron Ashford]], written without Cipher, and dated for sometime in the last few months
- On one of the cleaner shelves, the party finds a beautiful-looking bottle with a label that reads "Test Batch 7 – Clungunford Delivery"
- The rat statue has a riddle engraved in it. Tracing the answer in diseased blood opens the door to the Ratmancer's lair
	- Riddle:
		Unseen I kiss the young and old 
		Uncut by sword, unswayed by gold 
		Priest and pauper, rich and poor 
		All fight, bannerless, in my war 
		Bear my footprints, chase your death 
		Breathe my silence, cease your breath
