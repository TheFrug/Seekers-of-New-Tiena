![[The Eight Steps of Lazy RPG Prep#Review the Characters]]
%%

- [[Lucian Castemur Duskwood]]: Lucian and I have the same goal which is to put this cult behind us and be rid of it. Well I have the seperate goal of finding out more about the cult and how they were able to operate.
	- Key Moments this Session: Discovery in the lab/ratmancer's lair 
- [[Malachi]]: Understanding the new wrist warps as Malachi never has owned magical equipment. I would think he has seen/been around a ton but never owned himself.
	- Key Moments this Session: Attuning with [[Silksail]] and learning that the Sundering of [[Androticus]] was not an accident; it was caused by the Gods
- [[Calendula Serenada]]: Calendula wants her reward for saving the big mama jama. I want to see if theres anything we’ve missed in the dungeon or any areas we havent explored
	- Key Moments this Session: Seeing [[Flint Reverie]] leading negotiations with the [[Magram Tribe]], trying to convince them to trample through [[Bromzheath]] because "That's what happens when you defy the Unseelie" + to steal the [[Earthmother's Scythe]] + kill [[Ethereal Song]] and reclaim the treasures he stole hundreds of years ago + to turn [[Bromzheath]] into more [[Feywild]]
- [[Zod Byldamur]]
	- Key Moments this Session: Zod's wild magic has finally revealed his eighth effect, which deals necrotic damage. This leads Zod to meet his most evil ancestor, [[Ner'gall]], an ancient warlock pacted to several masters and loyal to none. This guy introduces the [[Umbral Conclave]] when Zod asks about [[Talona]]

# Opening Scene

The dust settles on the splattered ritual chamber. The air is heavy with the scent of bloody-soaked fur and rotting flesh. 
{Describe with the party what they are all doing}
As Zod's wild magic is about to fade, it surges and streams into Zod's head, putting him in a trance. DC 15 Wisdom save to not drop [[Pastor Edith]]. 
The next time Zod long rests, he has a strange dream and glows with wild magic energy.
In his mind, Zod is standing on a dry cliff in a mountainous region with a hazy green sky. Before him stands [[Ner'gall]], who is a spirit of the same color as Zod's wild magic surge. 

# Outline Potential Scenes

## Discoveries in the Lab and Ratmancer's Lair

### Scene Goals
- Players explore the Lab-O-Rat-Ory of the [[Temple of Talona]] and discover the Spreadsheet
- If players access the Ratmancer's Lair, they can find a journal with frantic scrawling about the "Rosy Bull" ([[Clungunford Rose]]) and how the [[Cult of Talona]] will reclaim their lost [[Relic]]: the [[Decanter of Unending Filth]], from him no matter the cost.

### READ ALOUD
You enter through the cramped stone archway into a small laboratory. The stagnant stench of the rest of the dungeon now pales in comparison to the multifaceted, nuanced rankness of this chamber. Inside there are bubbling cauldrons with various hues of muck encrusted around the rims, body parts lying on tables with pins holding them in place, and vials of empty and full potion bottles lining the shelves on the walls. At the opposite end of the room, there is a stone statue of a Rat statue. 
At one table, a rat in a lab coat haunches over a collection of bubbling vials and test tubes. With a twitch, he turns towards the party with a crazed look in his eye before loading his automatic crossbow with vials and screeching: "Sewer skewers for everyone!"
### Key Details

#### NPCs Involved
- **NPC Name:** [[Pastor Edith]]
	- Catch-up: Edith has just been rescued from having her soul drained as part of a ritual to summon the [[Herald of Rot]]. However, she is in a bad state and will need medicine, likely from [[Bevin Gladstar]] to heal. This is a sick narrative moment because Edith and the [[Conspiracy of the Earthmother's Scythe]] are the reason for [[Bevin Gladstar]]'s outdoor farm doing so poorly these past few years, as well as [[Fiona]]'s parents who were actually killed via poison from eating crops [[Clungunford Rose]] had given Talonian poison
	- Motivation: Survive. If can be communicated with, will ask if '[[Clungunford Rose|lil' Gunford]]' sent for them, if he's worrying about his auntie. She is grateful for the party's help
	- Secret/Challenge: She doesn't want to believe that [[Clungunford Rose]] set her up to be killed in order to monopolize the [[Earthmother's Scythe]]. 
		- If she realizes her life was given up for his plans, DC 20 Persuasion check: she can see reason and agree tell the party what she knows about the [[Conspiracy of the Earthmother's Scythe]], which is that [[Clungunford Rose]] has the true scythe and uses it selectively to gain power and control the people of [[Bromzheath]].
- **NPC Name:** [[Twitch the Lab Rat]]
	- Motivation: To finish his last experiment: to combine as many of the poisons and toxins as possible on one person and see what happens.
	- Secret/Challenge: The party is about to kill him lmao

### Secrets & Clues
- Spreadsheet of poisons/diseases requested by various sources, including powerful families and royalty from across [[Tiena]]. Columns: Ingredients and Dosages, recipient name, craftsman's signature, date, and status of completion.
	- Notable names: 
	- [[Clungunford Rose]]
	- [[Isadora Duskwood]], written in a cipher familiar to [[Lucian Castemur Duskwood]], older order
	- [[Desmond Ashford]], written without Cipher, and dated for sometime in the last few months
- On one of the cleaner shelves, the party finds a beautiful-looking bottle with a label that reads "Test Batch 7 – Clungunford Delivery", as well as three unlabeled potions of positive effect.
	- https://randomtablesrpg.com/fantasy/ultimate-random-potion-table-for-dnd-5e/
- DC 15 Investigation check: A locked box sealed with a tar-black wax that burns to the touch and displays the mark of [[Talona]]. It can be opened via magic of a cleric or devotee of [[Talona]] (like [[Brother Merric]]) or forced open by powerful tools.
	- Inside, there is a vial of an insanely potent and contagious illness, which is the [[Opus of Contagion]]. Merric sees it as incredibly dangerous and deserving of being destroyed. 
- The rat statue has a riddle engraved in it. Tracing the answer in diseased blood opens the door to the Ratmancer's lair
	- Riddle:
		Unseen I kiss the young and old 
		Uncut by sword, unswayed by gold 
		Priest and pauper, rich and poor 
		All fight, bannerless, in my war 
		Bear my footprints, chase your death 
		Breathe my silence, cease your breath

- Answer: Plague

### Leaving the Temple
- [[Sleuf Softmane]] stands over reeking the corpse of a lab rat, telling the party that he needs their help. He is accompanied by [[Reynauld Stonehoof]]. 
	- Sleuf was given their location by the Unseelie Fae, as the [[Redwood Panpipes]] give [[Dionaea]] and by extension [[Flint Reverie]] insight into [[Calendula Serenada]]'s location. 
- He can carry [[Pastor Edith]] home, as he can tell she needs help. 
- Along the way, he explains his people, the [[Magram Tribe]], are staying nearby
	- [[Bromzheath]] stands in the way of their [[High Hunt]]. 
	- The wardens are recommending a slight re-route, but the [[Unseelie Court]] operatives helping the Centuars rest are suggesting a violent trampling of [[Bromzheath]] to occur the following night.
- During the ride home, [[Calendula Serenada]] falls asleep and speaks to [[Dionaea]]
- [[Dionaea]] commends Calendula on defeating the [[Cult of Talona]], and tells her she can be rewarded if she likes.
	- If she says yes, on next long rest: A [[Charlatan's Die]] under her pillow.

### When Malachi attunes with Silksail

## Meeting with the Magram Tribe

### Scene Goals
- Re-introduce the centaurs from earlier as part of the [[Magram Tribe]] while introducing their motivations
- While meeting them, introduce the [[Unseelie Court]]'s involvement, as they have a revenge plot against [[Ethereal Song]] for stealing valuable treasures from the [[Dionaea]]

### READ ALOUD

You follow Sleuf's soft and swift stride through the forest. Slowly, the bark on trees passing by tints more and more yellow, and the leaves more and more pink. Eventually, you come to a beautiful clearing with a spring of running fresh water, large mushrooms sprouting under shady rocks, fae flitting about, and centaurs working on carving up a massive boar. 

### Key Details
- **Location:** Feywild grove in the middle of the woods near [[Bromzheath]]
- **Time of Day**: Cool Daytime
- **Mood/Atmosphere:** Beauty meets mystery, as the centaur are an imposing presence with an unfamiliar culture, and the Unseelie are an eminent threat to [[Calendula Serenada]].

#### NPCs Involved

	- Motivation: Convince [[Garmos Anth-Malar]] to rampage through [[Bromzheath]]. He explains that this is as punishment for building on their sacred land. 
	- Motivation: Convince [[Calendula Serenada]] to join the Unseelie, by force if he must. He will even cast enchantment spells on her to convince her of her potential with [[Dionaea]], and references their history together.
	- Secret/Challenge: Flint actually wants the [[Magram Tribe]] to rampage through [[Bromzheath]] in order to:
		- Raid the [[Honeydrop Hall]], kill [[Ethereal Song]], and seize the treasures he stole from [[Dionaea]]
		- capture [[Firbolg]] to re-integrate into the [[Unseelie Court]]
- **NPC Name:** [[Garmos Anth-Malar]]
	- Motivation: Carry out the [[High Hunt]] to glorify [[Malar]]
	- Secret/Challenge: Is being enchanted by [[Flint Reverie]] to feel bloodthirsty towards the [[Firbolg]] and [[Bromzheath]]
- **NPC Name:** [[Sleuf Softmane]]
	- Motivation: Carry out the chief's wishes without destroying [[Bromzheath]] or doing harm to civilizations, only wild beasts.
	- Secret/Challenge: Only has so much pull in the tribe as a younger warden. Has a fondness for non-migratory civilizations.

## Clungunford's Ball

### Scene Goals
- The party has to attend a formal Ball to celebrate their success against the [[Cult of Talona]]. 
- This ball is part of [[Clungunford Rose]]'s plan to transform [[Bromzheath]] from commune to kingdom, as he plans on striking a deal with [[Brenwin Al-avik]] to supply [[Bromzheath]] with equipment for the militia in exchange for a supply of food.
	- "Thanks to this here [[Earthmother's Scythe]], food is plentiful in [[Bromzheath]]"
	- Reveals that the party's scythe is a fake.
- Introduce [[Sasha Rose]], [[Clungunford Rose]]'s daughter, who he pushes onto [[Zod Byldamur]] as a date for the Ball, hoping the two fall in love so that [[Clungunford Rose]] can have another capable [[Byldamur Family|Byldamur]] to build his kingdom alongside [[Kotiri Byldamur]]
	- This will force [[Zod Byldamur]] to make a choice as to whether he wants to continue being a seeker or remain in [[Bromzheath]] with [[Kotiri Byldamur]]
