# Review the Characters

%%
Tip
![[The Eight Steps of Lazy RPG Prep#Review the Characters]]
%%
- [[Lucian Castemur Duskwood]]: Wants to bring Clungunford to justice after some investigating and interrogating. 
	- Follow through the cultist plan. Attend the party and confront him while he's meeting Brenwin. Hopefully they meet in the study. In there we can search for more evidence as well as maybe interrogate him. My dumbass did not write the name but I intend to take the evidence to the elder woman and convince her to hold an emergency trial against the baron. In the trial we will present the evidence to the people and let them decide the verdict.
- [[Zod Byldamur]]: Reconnect with Ner'Gall + investigate other family members spirits.
	- Prevent the High Hunt from happening in [[Bromzheath]] in order to protect [[Kotiri Byldamur]]. Also, keep [[Ricky Rat]] quiet because that's Zod's job
- [[Calendula Serenada]]: See [[Flint Reverie]]
	- I mean calendula in general would like to find out more about flint, but about the stampede, she’s just trying to go along with stopping it by pretending to be a priest of Talona
- [[Malachi]]: I think Malachi wants to confront the centaurs but this is a huge event to stand in front of instead of witnessing it to record it the Teller way.
	- Malachi can learn about [[Magram Tribe]] culture, which I already wrote about so sweet.

## Meeting with the Magram

### Scene Goals
- Introduce [[Magram Tribe]] culture and motivations
- Introduce [[Flint Reverie]] to the story and have a big moment with Calendula
- Figure out what side centaur will be on in final conflict

### READ ALOUD

### Key Details
- **Location:** Unseelie Oasis in the woods near [[Bromzheath]]
- **Time of Day**: Early afternoon, with sunlight beaming in through the trees and bouncing of the multicolored fungi and flowers at their bases.
- **Mood/Atmosphere:** Tense. The party is entering a foreign species' camp, and they are visibly sharpening weapons and feasting on raw meat to prepare for the evening hunt. Effigies to Malar burn, the smoke carrying the stench of flesh and incense.

#### NPCs Involved
- **[[Flint Reverie]]:** 
	- Motivation: Convince [[Magram Tribe]] to rampage through [[Bromzheath]] so as to carry out the [[Magram Tribe]]'s tradition in their ancestral path
	- Secret/Challenge: Is using a slowly building enchantment magic to enthrall the Magram Tribe's leader
	- Bigger Secret: The [[Unseelie Court]] want to see the High Hunt happen in order to raid [[Bromzheath]] of its citizens and [[Ethereal Song]]'s treasure.
- **[[Bobby Sparkles]]:** 
	- Motivation: Command [[Unseelie Court]] troops stationed in the [[Magram Tribe]] camp in case anything goes sideways.
	- Secret/Challenge: True goal is To weaken [[Bromzheath]] in order to re-capture [[Bromzheath]] as part of the [[Unseelie Court]]
- **[[Garmos Anth-Malar]]:** 
	- Motivation: To conduct the [[High Hunt]] and carry out [[Malar]]'s will. 
	- Secret/Challenge: Is being enchanted by [[Flint Reverie]] to be convinced by the Unseelie.
- **[[Sleuf Softmane]]:** 
	- Motivation: Re-route the [[High Hunt]] to go around [[Bromzheath]], maximizing the hunt while minimizing conflict with civilians.
	- Secret/Challenge: His tribe is not listening to reason, and his station as youngest warden limits his authority in their eyes.
- **[[Leaf Dancer]]:** 
	- Motivation: Protect the [[Magram Tribe]]
	- Secret/Challenge: Doesn't want to tell the tribe, but knows about how lords/kings think because she was forced into a deal with [[Desmond Ashford]]. 
- **[[Ricky Rat]]**
	- Motivation: Help the party with negotiations by putting on a good performance. 
	- Secret Challenge: Like the other members of [[Brenwin's Caravan]], [[Ricky Rat]] is fascinated by [[Centaur]], and thus has trouble containing his excitement when seeing them.
- **[[Brother Merric]]**
	- Motivation: Help the party with the negotiations by channeling his inner Talonan cultist, which is easy as he is an ex-member
	- Secret/Challenge: Acting like a cultist after having to prove his innocence just days ago is messing with Merric's head, and kind of sucks for him tbh.
## Rose Estate Ball

### Scene Goals
- Party can use this social environment to investigate Clungunford and plan to stop him
- Clungunford will reveal that Pastor Edith is alive and well, although she will not look 100% because Clungunford had people retrieve Edith from [[Bevin Gladstar]]'s home before treatment was done. 
- I'm sure it'll be fun either way!

### READ ALOUD

The Rose Estate's massive frame silhouettes against a sunset sky. Out front, a sign reads in elegant font: "Downsizing Required for Entry". At the door, [[Jeeves Butler]] greets guests and validates their invitation. 

### Key Details
- **Location:** [[Rose Estate]]
- **Time of Day**: Sunset evening. Perfect to cast warm light through the beautiful manor windows.
- **Mood/Atmosphere:** Elegant, poised, busy. There is a mix of elegant Firbolgs in their best imitations of ball gowns as well as farmers in simple folk who are socializing like its a normal party.

#### NPCs Involved
- **[[Clungunford Rose]]:** 
	- Motivation: To host the party successfully, upholding his status. In addition, Clungunford has two main political goals:
		- Use the recent kidnapping of [[Pastor Edith]] to justify arming the [[Bromzheath Militia]] further, while suggesting also that more hierarchichal leadership might also act as a good defense
		- Secure a trade deal with [[Brenwin Al-avik]] to gain arms and armor from [[Al-Qonidar]] in exchange for plentiful food.
	- Secret/Challenge: The party's presence is somewhat unwanted, as Clungunford is paranoid that they know of his plans based on their connection to [[Bevin Gladstar]]
- **[[Wintha Dovemeal]]:**
	- Motivation: To relax at the party and distract herself from [[Pastor Edith]]'s condition. Is very concerned with Edith's health
	- Secret/Challenge: Is suspicious of Clungunford's nature
- **[[Brenwin Al-avik]]:** 
	- Motivation: Eat some good food, learn local customs, and perhaps secure a lucrative trade deal with [[Clungunford Rose]] or someone else, since he knows Clungunford is bad news.
	- Secret/Challenge: Is afraid of Clungunford, especially knowing he poisoned people in the past.

### Secrets & Clues
- [[Clungunford Rose]] used the [[Cult of Talona]]'s poisons to weaken his cousin and [[Pastor Edith]]'s son, [[Broome Rose]]. 
- [[Clungunford Rose]] held control over the [[Cult of Talona]], using their [[Decanter of Unending Filth]] as collateral.
- [[Primrose Rose]] is being made to develop a bond with [[Lucian Castemur Duskwood]] by her father, who is hoping to connect the [[Rose Family]] to the [[Duskwood Clan]] via marriage.
