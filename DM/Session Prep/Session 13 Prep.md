## Encounters / Challenges

**Goal:** Exonerate Brother Merric from guilt while also concealing the fact that the party swiped the [[False Earthmother’s Scythe]]

**Opening:** The party comes to see the villagers gathered at the dirt circle, with Merric bound by silver chains to a stump at the center. Before him, there are three modest thrones, [[Baron Clungunford Rose]] sits in the central one. He is flanked by two older-looking Firbolgs, Turlough, the portly noble and a large female Firbolg. Behind Merric, there are two makeshift podiums bannered with the symbol of [[Chauntea]]. People sit and stand around the circle's edge.

Clungunford gives an opening statement, mourning the tragedy that befell [[Bromzheath]] the night prior, from the Bulette attack to the attack on [[Pastor Edith]]. He explains the rule of the trial, that The Whip will be acting as the prosecution for this trial, and asks if anyone(s) would like to step forward to act as Merric's defense, else Merric be defenseless in this trial.

### **Gameplay**

1. **Opening** – Merric is brought before the villagers; the shamans draw two glowing circles:
    - **Freedom** (white/green light)
    - **Condemnation** (red/black light)  
        Villagers show support by casting a **light cantrip** into one circle.
2. **Testimonies** – Each round, a witness is called.
    - **Predetermined NPCs:** Orrick, [[Walter 'The Whip' Wadsworth]], Shady Chauntean (Clungunford’s plant).
    - **PCs:** May give testimony or cross-examine.
    - **PCs may also call any village NPC they’ve bonded with.**
3. **Shamans’ Magic** – During testimony, shamans create **illusory visions** of what’s described, so the whole crowd sees events as told. (Exaggerations/falsehoods still appear unless countered.)
4. **Zone of Truth (once per side)**
    - Each side can cast **Zone of Truth** once.
    - **CHA save**: fail = cannot lie; success = can lie, but must roleplay believably.
    - Refusal to enter, silence, or evasive wording appears damning to the crowd.
    - **Insight checks (DC ~15):** May reveal someone is lying inside the zone.
5. **Villager Vote Tracking**
    - After each testimony, DM updates the **balance of lights** in Freedom/Condemnation circles.
    - **Skill checks (Persuasion, Deception, Intimidation, Insight, Religion, etc., DC 12–18)** during arguments can sway groups of villagers.
    - Final decision = whichever circle has more lights when all testimonies are heard.

### **False Evidence & Manipulation**

- **Orrick**: Nervous, tells what he saw honestly (Merric transformed). Can be swayed.
- **The Whip**: Cares about fairness; skeptical of Clungunford. May support Merric if PCs argue well.
- **Shady Chauntean:** Claims Merric was seen meeting cultists, spreading sickness, etc. **Blatant false testimony.** Supports Clungunford.
- **Clungunford’s Role:** Speaks to crowd about the “danger of outsiders,” frames the trial as about _the safety of Bromzheath vs corruption_.

### **Optional Twist: Cultist Interference**

- **If PCs are winning:** A hidden cultist forces Merric’s lycanthropy to trigger (either with poison, magic, or blood ritual).
    - Crowd panics; Clungunford calls for immediate execution.
    - PCs must argue that Merric was manipulated, or fight breaks out.
- **If PCs are losing:** Cultists hold back, hoping Merric will turn to them for protection after condemnation.

### **PC Involvement**

- PCs are **key witnesses and defenders**.
- Their testimony matters more than any NPC’s.
- Strong RP + clever Zone of Truth use = major influence on the crowd.

This way, you’ve got a **tight loop of gameplay**:

- NPC testimony → shamans visualize → PCs cross-examine → villagers react with lights → Zone of Truth used once per side → final vote.  
    The **cultist disruption** can be slotted in or skipped depending on pacing and outcome.
