# Kolbein Ironfist

Kolbein Ironfist-Dagsson is the jarl of [[Skiptaheimr]], and the party's patron in the [[One Shot - Justice in Jorundarholt (Working Title)]]. He is a nervous sort averse to work and danger alike. He earned his position through the Ironfist clan's heavy investment into [[Jorundarholt]]'s establishment. He is tolerated by the locals, who all seem to take him less seriously than he'd like.
