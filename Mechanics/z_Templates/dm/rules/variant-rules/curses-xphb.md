# Curses
*Source: the Free Rules (2024)* 

Some game effects curse a creature or an object. The effect that confers a curse defines what the curse does. Curses can be removed by the [Remove Curse](remove-curse-xphb.md) and [Greater Restoration](greater-restoration-xphb.md) spells or other magic that explicitly ends curses.
