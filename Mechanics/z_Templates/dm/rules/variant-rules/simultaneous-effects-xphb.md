# Simultaneous Effects
*Source: the Free Rules (2024)* 

If two or more things happen at the same time on a turn, the person at the game table—player or DM whose turn it is decides the order in which those things happen. For example, if two effects occur at the start of a [player character's](player-character-xphb.md) turn, the player decides which of the effects happens first.
