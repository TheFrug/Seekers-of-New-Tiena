# Arcane Eye
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*4th-level, Divination*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of bat fur)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You create an [Invisible](conditions.md#Invisible), invulnerable eye within range that hovers for the duration. You mentally receive visual information from the eye, which can see in every direction. It also has [Darkvision](senses.md#Darkvision) with a range of 30 feet.

As a [Bonus Action](bonus-action-xphb.md), you can move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction. A solid barrier blocks the eye's movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1 inch in diameter.

**Classes**: [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard.md); [Sorcerer (Draconic Sorcery)](list-spells-classes-sorcerer-xphb-draconic-sorcery-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard.md)
