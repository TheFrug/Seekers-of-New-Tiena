# Haste
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*3rd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a shaving of licorice root)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the target's [Speed](speed-xphb.md) is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to [Armor Class](armor-class-xphb.md), it has [Advantage](advantage-xphb.md) on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used to take only the [Attack](actions.md#Attack) (one attack only), [Dash](actions.md#Dash), [Disengage](actions.md#Disengage), [Hide](actions.md#Hide), or [Utilize](actions.md#Utilize) action.

When the spell ends, the target is [Incapacitated](conditions.md#Incapacitated) and has a [Speed](speed-xphb.md) of 0 until the end of its next turn, as a wave of lethargy washes over it.

**Classes**: [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard.md); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Bard (College of Lore)](list-spells-classes-bard-xphb-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB")
