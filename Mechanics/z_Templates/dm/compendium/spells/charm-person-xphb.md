One Humanoid you can see within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. It does so with [Advantage](advantage-xphb.md) if you or your allies are fighting it. On a failed save, the target has the [Charmed](conditions.md#Charmed) condition until the spell ends or until you or your allies damage it. The [Charmed](conditions.md#Charmed) creature is Friendly to you. When the spell ends, the target knows it was [Charmed](conditions.md#Charmed) by you.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 1.

**Classes**: [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard.md); [Warlock](list-spells-classes-warlock.md); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Druid](list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Bard (College of Lore)](list-spells-classes-bard-xphb-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB")
