# Fear
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*3rd-level, Illusion*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot Cone)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a white feather)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Each creature in a 30-foot Cone must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever it is holding and have the [Frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) condition for the duration.

A [Frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) creature takes the [Dash](actions.md#Dash) action and moves away from you by the safest route on each of its turns unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a space where it doesn't have line of sight to you, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends on that creature.

**Classes**: [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard.md); [Warlock](list-spells-classes-warlock.md); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Sorcerer (Draconic Sorcery)](list-spells-classes-sorcerer-xphb-draconic-sorcery-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Bard (College of Lore)](list-spells-classes-bard-xphb-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB")
