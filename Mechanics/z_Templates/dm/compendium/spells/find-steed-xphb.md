# Find Steed
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*2nd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You summon an otherworldly being that appears as a loyal steed in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. This creature uses the Otherworldly Steed stat block. If you already have a steed from this spell, the steed is replaced by the new one.

The steed resembles a Large, rideable animal of your choice, such as a horse, a camel, a dire wolf, or an elk. Whenever you cast the spell, choose the steed's creature type—Celestial, Fey, or Fiend—which determines certain traits in the stat block.

## Combat

The steed is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, it shares your [Initiative](initiative-xphb.md) count, and it functions as a controlled mount while you ride it (as defined in the rules on "mounted combat"). If you have the [Incapacitated](conditions.md#Incapacitated) condition, the steed takes its turn immediately after yours and acts independently, focusing on protecting you.

## Disappearance of the Steed

The steed disappears if it drops to 0 [Hit Points](hit-points-xphb.md) or if you die. When it disappears, it leaves behind anything it was wearing or carrying. If you cast this spell again, you decide whether you summon the steed that disappeared or a different one.

## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot

Use the spell slot's level for the spell's level in the stat block.
