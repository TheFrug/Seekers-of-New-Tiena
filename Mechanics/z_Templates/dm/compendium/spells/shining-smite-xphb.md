The target hit by the strike takes an extra `2d6` Radiant damage from the attack. Until the spell ends, the target sheds [Bright Light](bright-light-xphb.md) in a 5-foot radius, attack rolls against it have [Advantage](advantage-xphb.md), and it can't benefit from the [Invisible](conditions.md#Invisible) condition.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `1d6` for each spell slot level above 2.

**Classes**: [Paladin](list-spells-classes-paladin.md)
