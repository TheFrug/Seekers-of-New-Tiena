# Vampiric Touch
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*3rd-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The touch of your shadow-wreathed hand can siphon life force from others to heal your wounds. Make a melee spell attack against one creature within reach. On a hit, the target takes `3d6` Necrotic damage, and you regain [Hit Points](hit-points-xphb.md) equal to half the amount of Necrotic damage dealt.

Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action, targeting the same creature or a different one.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `1d6` for each spell slot level above 3.

**Classes**: [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard.md); [Warlock](list-spells-classes-warlock.md); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Bard (College of Lore)](list-spells-classes-bard-xphb-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB")
