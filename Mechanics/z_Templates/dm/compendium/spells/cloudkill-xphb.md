# Cloudkill
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*5th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a 20-foot-radius Sphere of yellow-green fog centered on a point within range. The fog lasts for the duration or until strong wind (such as the one created by [Gust of Wind](gust-of-wind-xphb.md)) disperses it, ending the spell. Its area is [Heavily Obscured](heavily-obscured-xphb.md).

Each creature in the Sphere makes a Constitution saving throw, taking `5d8` Poison damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this save when the Sphere moves into its space and when it enters the Sphere or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

The Sphere moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `1d8` for each spell slot level above 5.

**Classes**: [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard.md); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard.md)
