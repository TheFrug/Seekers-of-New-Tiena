# Produce Flame
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*cantrip, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 10 minutes

A flickering flame appears in your hand and remains there for the duration. While there, the flame emits no heat and ignites nothing, and it sheds [Bright Light](bright-light-xphb.md) in a 20-foot radius and [Dim Light](dim-light-xphb.md) for an additional 20 feet. The spell ends if you cast it again.

Until the spell ends, you can take a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action to hurl fire at a creature or an object within 60 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes `1d8` Fire damage.

**Cantrip Upgrade.** The damage increases by `1d8` when you reach levels 5 (`2d8`), 11 (`3d8`), and 17 (`4d8`).

**Classes**: [Druid](list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Bard (College of Lore)](list-spells-classes-bard-xphb-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB")
