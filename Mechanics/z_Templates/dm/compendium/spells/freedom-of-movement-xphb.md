# Freedom of Movement
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*4th-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a leather strap)
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target's movement is unaffected by [Difficult Terrain](difficult-terrain-xphb.md), and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target's [Speed](speed-xphb.md) nor cause the target to have the [Paralyzed](conditions.md#Paralyzed) or [Restrained](conditions.md#Restrained) conditions. The target also has a [Swim Speed](swim-speed-xphb.md) equal to its [Speed](speed-xphb.md).

In addition, the target can spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature imposing the [Grappled](conditions.md#Grappled) condition on it.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 4.

**Classes**: [Druid (Circle of the Land)](list-spells-classes-druid-xphb-circle-of-the-land-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Paladin (Oath of Devotion)](list-spells-classes-paladin-xphb-oath-of-devotion-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Druid](list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Cleric](list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Ranger](list-spells-classes-ranger.md)
