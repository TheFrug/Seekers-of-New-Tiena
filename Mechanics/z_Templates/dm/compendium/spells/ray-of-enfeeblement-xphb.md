A beam of enervating energy shoots from you toward a creature within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the target has [Disadvantage](disadvantage-xphb.md) on the next attack roll it makes until the start of your next turn.

On a failed save, the target has [Disadvantage](disadvantage-xphb.md) on Strength-based [D20 Tests](d20-test-xphb.md) for the duration. During that time, it also subtracts `1d8` from all its damage rolls. The target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell on a success.

**Classes**: [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard.md); [Warlock](list-spells-classes-warlock.md); [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Bard (College of Lore)](list-spells-classes-bard-xphb-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB")
