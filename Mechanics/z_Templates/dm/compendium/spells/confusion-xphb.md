# Confusion
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*4th-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (three nut shells)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Each creature in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or that target can't take Bonus Actions or Reactions and must roll `1d10` at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn, consulting the table below.

`dice: [](confusion-xphb.md#^1-behavior-for-the-turn)`

| dice: 1d10 | Behavior for the Turn |
|------------|-----------------------|
| 1 | The target doesn't take an action, and it uses all its movement to move. Roll `1d4` for the direction: **1**, north; **2**, east; **3**, south; or **4**, west. |
| 2-6 | The target doesn't move or take actions. |
| 7-8 | The target doesn't move, and it takes the [Attack](actions.md#Attack) action to make one melee attack against a random creature within reach. If none are within reach, the target takes no action. |
| 9-10 | The target chooses its behavior. |
^1-behavior-for-the-turn

At the end of each of its turns, an affected target repeats the save, ending the spell on itself on a success.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The Sphere's radius increases by 5 feet for each spell slot level above 4.

**Classes**: [Wizard](list-spells-classes-wizard.md); [Sorcerer](list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Bard](list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Druid](list-spells-classes-druid.md)
