# Gem of Seeing
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  


This gem has 3 charges. As a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action, you can expend 1 charge. For the next 10 minutes, you have [Truesight](senses.md#Truesight) out to 120 feet when you peer through the gem.

The gem regains `1d3` expended charges daily at dawn.
