# Holy Water
*Adventuring gear*  

- **Cost**: 25 gp
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

When you take the [Attack](actions.md#Attack) action, you can replace one of your attacks with throwing a flask of Holy Water. Target one creature you can see within 20 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and [Proficiency Bonus](proficiency-xphb.md)) or take `2d8` Radiant damage if it is a Fiend or an Undead.
