# Potion of Animal Friendship
*Potion, uncommon*  

- **Weight**: 0.5 lbs.

When you drink this potion, you can cast the level 3 version of the [Animal Friendship](animal-friendship-xphb.md) spell (save DC 13).

Agitating this potion's muddy liquid brings little bits into view: a fish scale, a hummingbird feather, a cat claw, or a squirrel hair.
