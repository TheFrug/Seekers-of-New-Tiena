# Alchemist's Fire
*Adventuring gear*  

- **Cost**: 50 gp
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

When you take the [Attack](actions.md#Attack) action, you can replace one of your attacks with throwing a flask of Alchemist's Fire. Target one creature or object you can see within 20 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and [Proficiency Bonus](proficiency-xphb.md)) or take `1d4` Fire damage and start [Burning](burning-xphb.md).
