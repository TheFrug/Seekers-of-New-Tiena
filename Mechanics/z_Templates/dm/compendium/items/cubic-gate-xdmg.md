# Cubic Gate
*Wondrous item, legendary*  


This cube is 3 inches across and radiates palpable magical energy. The six sides of the cube are each keyed to a different plane of existence, one of which is the Material Plane. The other sides are linked to planes determined by the DM.

The cube has 3 charges and regains `1d3` expended charges daily at dawn. As a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action, you can expend 1 of the cube's charges to cast one of the following spells using the cube.

## Gate

Pressing one side of the cube, you cast [Gate](gate-xphb.md), opening a portal to the plane of existence keyed to that side.

## Plane Shift

Pressing one side of the cube twice, you cast [Plane Shift](plane-shift-xphb.md), transporting the targets to the plane of existence keyed to that side.
