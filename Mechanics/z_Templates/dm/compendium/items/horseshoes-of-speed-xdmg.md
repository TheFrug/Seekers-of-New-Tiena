# Horseshoes of Speed
*Wondrous item, rare*  


These horseshoes come in a set of four. As a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action, you can touch one of the horseshoes to the hoof of a horse or similar creature, whereupon the horseshoe affixes itself to the hoof. Removing a horseshoe also takes a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action.

While all four horseshoes are attached to the same creature, its [Speed](speed-xphb.md) is increased by 30 feet.
