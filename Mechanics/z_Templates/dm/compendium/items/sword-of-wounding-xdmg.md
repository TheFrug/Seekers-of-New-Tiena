# Sword of Wounding
*Rare (requires attunement)*  


When you hit a creature with an attack using this magic weapon, the target takes an extra `2d6` Necrotic damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be unable to regain [Hit Points](hit-points-xphb.md) for 1 hour. The target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
