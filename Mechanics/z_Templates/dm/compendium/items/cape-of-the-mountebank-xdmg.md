# Cape of the Mountebank
*Wondrous item, rare*  


This cape smells faintly of brimstone. While wearing it, you can use it to cast [Dimension Door](dimension-door-xphb.md) as a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

When you teleport with that spell, you leave behind a cloud of smoke. The space you left is [Lightly Obscured](lightly-obscured-xphb.md) by that smoke until the end of your next turn.
