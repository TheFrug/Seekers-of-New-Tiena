# Armor of Vulnerability (Slashing)
*Cursed item, rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [Cursed](rules/item-properties.md#Cursed%20Items)

While wearing this armor, you have [Resistance](Mechanics/z_Templates/dm/rules/variant-rules/resistance-xphb.md) to Slashing damage.

## Curse

This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when the [Identify](identify-xphb.md) spell is cast on the armor or you attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you until you are targeted by a [Remove Curse](remove-curse-xphb.md) spell or similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed, you have [Vulnerability](vulnerability-xphb.md) to Bludgeoning and Piercing damage.
