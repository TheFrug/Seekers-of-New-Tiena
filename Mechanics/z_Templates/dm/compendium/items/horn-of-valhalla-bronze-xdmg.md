# Horn of Valhalla, Bronze
*Wondrous item, very rare*  


You can take a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the plane of Ysgard appear in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you. Each spirit uses the [Berserker](berserker-xmm.md) stat block and returns to Ysgard after 1 hour or when it drops to 0 [Hit Points](hit-points-xphb.md). The spirits look like living, breathing warriors, and they have [Immunity](immunity-xphb.md) to the [Charmed](conditions.md#Charmed) and [Frightened](conditions.md#Frightened) conditions. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

A bronze horn summons 4 [Berserkers](berserker-xmm.md). To use the bronze horn, you must have training with all Medium armor.

If you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned [Berserkers](berserker-xmm.md) attack you. If you meet the requirement, they are [Friendly](friendly-attitude-xphb.md) to you and your allies and follow your commands.
