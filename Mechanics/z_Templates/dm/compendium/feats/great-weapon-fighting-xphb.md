# Great Weapon Fighting
*Source: SRD 5.2 and the Free Rules (2024)*  
When you roll damage for an attack you make with a Melee weapon that you are holding with two hands, you can treat any 1 or 2 on a damage die as a 3. The weapon must have the Two-Handed or Versatile property to gain this benefit.
