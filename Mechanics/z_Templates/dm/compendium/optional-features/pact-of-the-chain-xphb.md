# Pact of the Chain
*Source: SRD 5.2 and the Free Rules (2024)*  
You learn the [Find Familiar](find-familiar-xphb.md) spell and can cast it as a [Magic](actions.md#Magic) action without expending a spell slot.

When you cast the spell, you choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: [Imp](imp-xmm.md), [Pseudodragon](pseudodragon-xmm.md), [Quasit](quasit-xmm.md), [Skeleton](skeleton-xmm.md), [Slaad Tadpole](slaad-tadpole-xmm.md), [Sphinx of Wonder](sphinx-of-wonder-xmm.md), [Sprite](sprite-xmm.md), or [Venomous Snake](venomous-snake-xmm.md) (see appendix B for the familiar's stat block).

Additionally, when you take the [Attack](actions.md#Attack) action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its [Reaction](reaction-xphb.md).
