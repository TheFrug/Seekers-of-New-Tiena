# Fiendish Vigor
*Source: SRD 5.2 and the Free Rules (2024)*  
**Prerequisite**: 2nd Warlock
You can cast [False Life](false-life-xphb.md) on yourself without expending a spell slot. When you cast the spell with this feature, you don't roll the die for the [Temporary Hit Points](temporary-hit-points-xphb.md); you automatically get the highest number on the die.
