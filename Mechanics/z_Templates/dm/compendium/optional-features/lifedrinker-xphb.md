# Lifedrinker
*Source: SRD 5.2 and the Free Rules (2024)*  
**Prerequisite**: 9th Warlock
Once per turn when you hit a creature with your pact weapon, you can deal an extra `1d6` Necrotic, Psychic, or Radiant damage (your choice) to the creature, and you can expend one of your [Hit Point Dice](hit-point-dice-xphb.md) to roll it and regain a number of [Hit Points](hit-points-xphb.md) equal to the roll plus your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 [Hit Point](hit-points-xphb.md)).
