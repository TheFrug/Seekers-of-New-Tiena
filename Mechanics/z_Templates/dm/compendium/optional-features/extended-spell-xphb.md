# Extended Spell
*Source: SRD 5.2 and the Free Rules (2024)*  
When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to double its duration to a maximum duration of 24 hours.

If the affected spell requires [Concentration](conditions.md#Concentration), you have [Advantage](advantage-xphb.md) on any saving throw you make to maintain that [Concentration](conditions.md#Concentration).
