# One with Shadows
*Source: SRD 5.2 and the Free Rules (2024)*  
**Prerequisite**: 5th Warlock
While you're in an area of [Dim Light](dim-light-xphb.md) or [Darkness](Mechanics/z_Templates/dm/rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md), you can cast [Invisibility](invisibility-xphb.md) on yourself without expending a spell slot.
