# Phase Spider
*Source: SRD 5.2*  

## Phase Spider

*Plane-Shifting Arachnid Ambusher*

- **Habitat.** Desert, Forest, Grassland, Hill, Planar (Ethereal Plane), Underdark, Urban  
- **Treasure.** Any  

Phase spiders appear out of nowhere to attack, then vanish just as swiftly. These horse-size, magical arachnids are endemic to the Ethereal Plane. From vaporous lairs, they peer through the Border Ethereal into the Material Plane. When they detect prey, phase spiders draw close and then shift or "phase" to the Material Plane to attack. They shift between planes of existence and attack from unexpected directions until they overcome their prey or are forced to retreat.

Phase spiders are more intelligent than mundane spiders, but most are cowards. They usually flee if they're outnumbered by creatures capable of seeing them on the Ethereal Plane or pursuing them there. They make exceptions for ghosts and similar spirits, which phase spiders gain sustenance from and pursue as favored prey.

***Ethereal Sight.*** The spider can see 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane while on the Material Plane and vice versa.

***Spider Climb.*** The spider can climb difficult surfaces, including along ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Web Walker.*** The spider ignores movement restrictions caused by webs, and the spider knows the location of any other creature in contact with the same web.

***Bite.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* `+5`, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 8 (`1d10 + 3`) Piercing damage plus 9 (`2d8`) Poison damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 [Hit Points](rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md), the target becomes [Stable](rules/variant-rules/stable-xphb.md), and it has the [Poisoned](rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition for 1 hour. While [Poisoned](rules/conditions.md#Poisoned), the target also has the [Paralyzed](rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed) condition.
