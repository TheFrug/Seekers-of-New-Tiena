# Grimlock
*Source: SRD 5.2*  

## Grimlock

*Puppet of the Mind Flayer Menace*

- **Habitat.** Underdark  
- **Treasure.** None  

Grimlocks are victims of biological manipulation by mind flayers. To create grimlocks, illithids capture Humanoids, expose them to strange forms of Underdark radiation, and implant new directives into their brains. The process of creating a grimlock rends the creature's mind such that no semblance of the individual's former personality remains.

Grimlocks have shallow depressions rather than eyes. A sixth sense allows grimlocks to perceive their surroundings. Psychic energies from their transformations linger in grimlocks' bodies, and they channel these eerie forces into their attacks.

Roll on or choose a result from the Grimlock Tasks table to inspire how grimlocks serve illithids.
