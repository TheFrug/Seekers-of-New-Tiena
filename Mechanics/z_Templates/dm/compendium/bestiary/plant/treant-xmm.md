# Treant
*Source: SRD 5.2*  

## Treant

*Wise and Mighty Animate Tree*

- **Habitat.** Forest  
- **Treasure.** None  

Ancient inhabitants of the forest, treants are gigantic, animate trees with wizened faces. Most have lived for centuries and know secrets of the natural world. They avoid becoming embroiled in the conflicts of shorter-lived creatures, but they're protective of their forest homes. If roused to anger, treants can animate trees to aid them.

Treants defend and are shaped by secrets of the forest. Roll on or choose a result from the Treant Secrets table to inspire what mysteries a treant protects.

## Traits

***Siege Monster.*** The treant deals double damage to objects and structures.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The treant makes two Slam attacks.

***Slam.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* `+10`, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 16 (`3d6 + 6`) Bludgeoning damage.

***Hail of Bark.*** *Ranged Attack Roll:* `+10`, range 180 ft. *Hit:* 28 (`4d10 + 6`) Piercing damage.

***Animate Trees (1/Day).*** The treant magically animates up to two trees it can see within 60 feet of itself. Each tree uses the Treant stat block, except it has Intelligence and Charisma scores of 1, it can't speak, and it lacks this action. The tree takes its turn immediately after the treant on the same [Initiative](rules/variant-rules/initiative-xphb.md) count, and it obeys the treant. A tree remains animate for 1 day or until it dies, the treant dies, or it is more than 120 feet from the treant. The tree then takes root if possible.
