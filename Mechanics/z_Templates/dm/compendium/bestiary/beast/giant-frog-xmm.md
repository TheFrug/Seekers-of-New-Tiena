## Animals

Use these stat blocks to represent the creatures they're named for or other similar creatures. For example, the [Panther](panther-xmm.md) stat block can also represent a mountain lion, while the [Giant Goat](giant-goat-xmm.md) stat block might represent a buffalo. Any of these stat blocks might also serve as fantastical animals with distinctive names and cosmetic details unique to your D&D adventures.

## Traits

***Amphibious.*** The frog can breathe air and water.

***Standing Leap.*** The frog's [Long Jump](rules/variant-rules/long-jump-xphb.md) is up to 20 feet and its [High Jump](rules/variant-rules/high-jump-xphb.md) is up to 10 feet with or without a running start.

## Actions

***Bite.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* `+3`, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 5 (`1d6 + 2`) Piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it has the [Grappled](rules/conditions.md#Grappled) condition (escape DC 11).

***Swallow.*** The frog swallows a Small or smaller target it is grappling. While swallowed, the target isn't [Grappled](rules/conditions.md#Grappled) but has the [Blinded](rules/conditions.md#Blinded) and [Restrained](rules/conditions.md#Restrained) conditions, and it has [Total Cover](rules/variant-rules/cover-xphb.md) against attacks and other effects outside the frog. While swallowing the target, the frog can't use Bite, and if the frog dies, the swallowed target is no longer [Restrained](rules/conditions.md#Restrained) and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting with the [Prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone) condition.

At the end of the frog's next turn, the swallowed target takes 5 (`2d4`) Acid damage. If that damage doesn't kill it, the frog disgorges it, causing it to exit [Prone](rules/conditions.md#Prone).
