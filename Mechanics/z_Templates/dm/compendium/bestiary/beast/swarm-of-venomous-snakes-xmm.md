## Animals

Use these stat blocks to represent the creatures they're named for or other similar creatures. For example, the [Panther](panther-xmm.md) stat block can also represent a mountain lion, while the [Giant Goat](giant-goat-xmm.md) stat block might represent a buffalo. Any of these stat blocks might also serve as fantastical animals with distinctive names and cosmetic details unique to your D&D adventures.

***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny snake. The swarm can't regain [Hit Points](rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) or gain [Temporary Hit Points](rules/variant-rules/temporary-hit-points-xphb.md).

## Actions

***Bites.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* `+6`, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 8 (`1d8 + 4`) Piercing damage—or 6 (`1d4 + 4`) Piercing damage if the swarm is [Bloodied](rules/variant-rules/bloodied-xphb.md)—plus 10 (`3d6`) Poison damage.
