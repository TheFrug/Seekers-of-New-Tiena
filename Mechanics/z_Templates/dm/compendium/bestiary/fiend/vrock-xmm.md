# Vrock
*Source: SRD 5.2*  

## Vrock

*Demon of Carnage and Ruin*

- **Habitat.** Planar (Abyss)  
- **Treasure.** Armaments  

Screeching, vulturelike demons, vrocks soar from the Abyss to spread ruin and slaughter. Their filthy feathers carry magical toxins from the Lower Planes, creating a noxious cloud capable of killing those who escape the vrocks' vicious beaks and claws. To further terrorize their foes, vrocks unleash an otherworldly screech so terrible it can halt creatures in their tracks.

## Traits

***Demonic Restoration.*** If the vrock dies outside the Abyss, its body dissolves into ichor, and it gains a new body instantly, reviving with all its [Hit Points](rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) somewhere in the Abyss.

***Magic Resistance.*** The vrock has [Advantage](rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The vrock makes two Shred attacks.

***Shred.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* `+6`, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 10 (`2d6 + 3`) Piercing damage plus 10 (`3d6`) Poison damage.

***Spores (Recharge 6).*** *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 15, each creature in a 20-foot <span title="Player's Handbook (2024)">Emanation</span> originating from the vrock. *Failure:* The target has the [Poisoned](rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition and repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. While [Poisoned](rules/conditions.md#Poisoned), the target takes 5 (`1d10`) Poison damage at the start of each of its turns. Emptying a flask of Holy Water on the target ends the effect early.

***Stunning Screech (1/Day).*** *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 15, each creature in a 20-foot <span title="Player's Handbook (2024)">Emanation</span> originating from the vrock (demons succeed automatically). *Failure:* 10 (`3d6`) Thunder damage, and the target has the [Stunned](rules/conditions.md#Stunned) condition until the end of the vrock's next turn.
