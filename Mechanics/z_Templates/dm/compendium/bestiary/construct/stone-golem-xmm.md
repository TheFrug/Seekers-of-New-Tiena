# Stone Golem
*Source: SRD 5.2 and the Free Rules (2024)*  

## Stone Golem

*Guardian of the Storied and Sacred*

- **Habitat.** Any  
- **Treasure.** None  

Stone golems take varied forms, such as weathered carvings of ancient deities, lifelike sculptures of heroes, or any other shape their makers imagine. No matter their design or the rock from which they're crafted, these golems are strengthened by the magic that animates them, allowing them to follow their creators' orders for centuries.

Stone golems are typically created to protect places of significance to a group, such as a monument to an important event, a leader's tomb, or a faith's sanctuary. Roll on or choose a result from the Stone Golem Orders table to inspire the commands a stone golem follows.
