# Adult Copper Dragon
*Source: SRD 5.2*  

Adult copper dragons use their influence to better the world. With broad circles of friends, adult copper dragons delight in introducing people to one another and helping people find places where they can flourish. When disaster strikes, these dragons draw on their family of contacts to offer support, right wrongs, and rebuild stronger than before.

## Copper Dragons

*Dragons of Curiosity and Community*

- **Habitat.** Hill  
- **Treasure.** Arcana  

Relentlessly friendly and curious, most copper dragons view the world as a place of endless wonder and possibility. These gregarious dragons are fonts of patience, hospitality, and humor, and they seek to improve the lives—or, at least, the mood—of those they interact with. If forced to fight to defend themselves or their friends, these dragons favor using their slowing breath and physical attacks to subdue antagonists. Only in cases of extreme peril or emotion do they use their deadly acid breath.

Copper dragons typically live in caverns amid picturesque hills and rock formations—particularly those that are prominent landmarks. These dragons collect gifts, though they have little interest in treasure without meaning, no matter how valuable it is. To them, thoughtfully given presents and the feelings or memories they symbolize are more important than masterpieces or magical relics.

### Copper Dragon Lairs

Copper dragons typically inhabit multichamber caves and renovated ruins.
