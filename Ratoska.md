A type of [[Fae]] that can magically worm its way into a creature and badger it with any truth the Ratoska in question knows. While Ratoska were originally simple mischief-makers, they have spent the last 70 years or so acting as spies/psychological attacks. They provide specific pieces of truth, but often not the entire context, in order to spur victims into action, partially out of desparation to get the voice out of their head.
