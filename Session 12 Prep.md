## Merric's Trial

The entire session will be the players gathering testimony for the trial of Merric, which will take place shortly before sunset. Before then, the players are encouraged to fulfill quests

Merric will either be exiled, or he will be freed. There is a chance if he is freed that the Firbolgs will require that he undergo treatment for his lycanthropy, which the party can weigh in on.

### Herbalist Shop

The Herbalist is a Firbolg who has more devotion to a new god of agriculture, who is revealed to be her patron, a Fae who spent her life helping mortals with medicine for her tricks. She might know of a cure for Malachi's lycanthropy, but they will have to find it in a dangerous creature's nest.

- Secret: The herbalist knows about Merric because Pastor Edith brought Merric to her to ask if she could cure him, but Merric never went through with the treatment, as he likes being a Wererat


### Church of Chauntea Wreckage

Lots of orphan kids clearing out rubble, one uncovers a buried corpse of a cultist and goes EEEEEK. Kids can give testimony about Merric
