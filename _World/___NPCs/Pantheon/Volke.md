## Summary

[[Volke]] is the main antagonist of [[The Seekers of New Tiena]]'s main story. He is the god of scavengers who orchestrated the [[War of the Gods]] and the Sundering of [[Androticus]] in order to collect [[Relic|relics]] from across [[Tiena]], expanding his godly portfolio until he reached enough power to usurp the Pantheon of gods and reign supreme over [[Tiena]]. 

[[Volke]] is the pact-holder of [[Captain Bridget]], as well as the owner of the [[The Seekers of New Tiena|Seekers's]] souls, making the players pawns in [[Volke]]'s scheme. The reason he does this is because [[Gods]] cannot interfere directly with the mortal plane that [[Tiena]] resides in.

 - **Significant Flaw:** Other than being a power-hungry, scheming, lying cretin, Volke is unexpectedly loyal to his mortal devotees like [[Captain Bridget]].

## Backstory

### Volke's Scheme

- Gain the trust of other minor evil gods by teaching them how to connect with mortals. This eventually led to the formation of the [[Umbral Conclave]]
- Slowly begin to suggest to the other members of the [[Umbral Conclave]] that a rebellion against the major gods could be good for all of them.
- At the same time, begin informing the major gods of the [[Umbral Conclave]]'s plotting, currying favor with the benevolent Gods that would become the [[Reckoners]]
- Abstain from the ensuing [[War of the Gods]], but observe which evil and good gods perish.
- Lie low, building more connections with mortals as well as benevolent gods.
- When the benevolent gods check in on [[Tiena]] for the first time in ages and learn of [[Androticus]], they panic, and [[Volke]] suggests nuking the city, leading to the Sundering of [[Androticus]]
- Using godly powers scavenged from a [[dead God of Undeath]], Volke revives a curated list of dead from [[Androticus]] and assigns [[Captain Bridget]] as their leader.
- Now, while [[Captain Bridget]] handles executive decisions, [[Volke]] bides his time until he has amassed enough power to reach his [[Patchwork Apotheosis]]
