## Summary

 - **Secret or Obstacle:** Bridget is a lover at heart, and is afraid of appearing "soft" to her subordinates.  Her love and loyalty to her crew may interfere with her allegiance to [[Volke]], as in many cases she will prioritize her people's well-being over sticking to a plan.

## Backstory
Captain Bridget is a leader at heart. Starting out as the captain of one of the most prosperous crews in the Istalean Sea, it wasn't long before she aspired to a greater position, eventually stabbing enough backs to become the admiral of [[The Istalean Coalition]]'s navy. 

In the process of achieving this, she discovered and struck a contract with an old god: [[Volke]], the Scavenger. Volke saw potential in her, and offered great power at very little cost: just that Bridget would do a favor for him when the time came. Being an honorable sort (minus the backstabbing part), Bridget accepted the terms. 

Volke waited over 20 years to cash in on his favor. Once he did, Bridget had to leave her adventurous life in the [[Istalean Sea]] to lead Volke's scavenger hunt for [[Relic|Godly Relics]].
