# Durin the Lash

## Description
- **Name:** Durin the Lash
- **Race/Species:** [[dwarf-xphb|Dwarf]]
- **Gender:** Male
- **Age:** 367 (now dead)
- **Occupation/Class:** Monk
- **Affiliation:** [[Teller]], [[Splinter Xenobium]]
- **Alignment:** True Neutral
- **Appearance:** A toned dwarf built like an acrobat. Durin wears a dark tank-top to free his arm movement, and sports a powerful moustache. He insists on shaving his fast-growing beard twice daily for "aerodynamics", but always ends up with some stubble or a shadow.

## Summary
Durin is a dead [[Teller|Teller]] the party discovered in the [[Cult of Talona]] dungeon wearing [[Silksail]], his signature magic item. Durin's consciousness possessed the [[Silksail]] shortly before his death, as he used the last of his Ki to do so rather than ward off his poison for a rescue he knew was never coming. He holds knowledge about [[Androticus]] that he was meant to share with the rest of his [[Xenobium]] upon their next meeting. 

Durin is a self-centered braggart who spends more time interpreting history than retelling it objectively, but was still loved by his [[Xenobium]] for his wit and capability in combat. 

## Roleplaying
 - **Wants and Needs:** To reach the rest of his [[Xenobium]]. Also, he wants to connect with [[Malachi]] since he is a [[Teller|Teller]]
 - **Secret or Obstacle:** He is dead and becomes uncontactable if [[Malachi]] takes off [[Silksail]]
 - **Significant Flaw:** He is dead. Also kind of a prick.
 - **Carrying:** [[Silksail]], a Teller pin made from gems and iron
