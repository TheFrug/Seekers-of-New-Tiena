## Summary
Ner'gall is an ancient warlock and necromancer who raised an army of undead so powerful it dominated an entire continent, leading to his 800-year rule. Over the course of this period, he sired many offspring, and would often absorb the souls of their mothers to extend his own life. 

Ner'Gall is pacted to multiple patrons throughout his lifetime, and ends up betraying most of them one way or another. The only deity to whom Ner'gall has true devotion is [[Myrkul]], though he has respect for all members of the [[Umbral Conclave]]. He is surprised if he learns that many of them died.

He now possesses Zod Byldamur alongside seven other ancestors of the [[Byldamur Family]]. Together, they provide Zod with powers as well as insights, but Ner'gall only does so in pursuit of Zod's loyalty.

## Roleplaying
 - **Wants and Needs:** To convince [[Zod Byldamur]] to heed the powers of the warlock class
 - **Secret or Obstacle:** Ner'gall wants Zod under his control in order to carry out a ritual that will seize control over all people on Tiena who have his blood to begin building a new empire, intending to possess Zod in order to rule the plane once more.
 - **Significant Flaw:** Evil as fuck and not subtle about it. Has totally gone insane over the course of his rule and relishes doing bad stuff
 - **Carrying:**
