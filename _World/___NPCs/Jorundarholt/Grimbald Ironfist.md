# Grimbald Ironfist

## Description
- **Name:** Grimbald Ironfist
- **Race/Species:** Dark-iron Dwarf
- **Gender:** Male
- **Age:** 420 (Getting on in years)
- **Occupation/Class:** Thane
- **Affiliation:** [[Clan Ironfist]], [[Skriptaheimr]]
- **Alignment:** Lawful Neutral
- **Appearance:** Grimbald's name is fitting, with his bald head and a serious expression that always creases his soot-colored face. Grimbald wears an eyepatch with an insignia of [[Clangeddin Silverbeard]], the Dwarven god of battle.

## Summary

Grimbald Ironfist is a loyal member of [[Clan Ironfist]] who was taken in after [[Clan Silverbeard]] was obliterated in a counter-attack by Clan Ironfist some hundred years ago. Since then, Grimbald has served as a talented warrior, until his old age allowed him to slot nicely into position as [[Kolbein Ironfist]]'s thane and confidant.
