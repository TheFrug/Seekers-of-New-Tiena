## Summary
Rasaad yn Yoko is a warlock whose patron, [[Balthazaar]], is tricksy and playful, having cursed Rasaad with only being able to make and eat sushi rolls for his entire life in exchange for awesome power, which Rasaad sought out to defend his mountainous home, which didn't have the necessary ingredients to create sushi. Having left home in order to subsist, Rasaad is now questing for ways to protect his home and his family (husband, daughter, elderly parents), even if from afar.

Rasaad has a unique spell slot reserved to cast [[haste-xphb|Haste]] but only to craft sushi. This was granted by Balthazaar as a small mercy, with the contingency that if he does not create a roll before the spell ends, he will suffer dire consequences.
