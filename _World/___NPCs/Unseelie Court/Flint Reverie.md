## Summary
When [[Calendula Serenada]] was a young sprite, she was an outcast with very few friends save for Flint Reverie, a misunderstood punk sprite around her age with a similar penchant for getting into trouble. The two were friends for many years before being conscripted into the Seelie military, where Flint was last seen covering Calendula's escape. He has since been missing, working for the Unseelie Court who took him in and nursed him back to health.

Flint is a Cultural Ambassador, responsible for communicating with "grey zone" Fae, pushing Unseelie goals forward by appealing to their shared cultural roots as Fae. His job is to make first contact with a neutral faction like the [[Magram Tribe]], acting as the friendly face of the Unseelie Court in the region. He then enacts a plan, often twisting the target's traditions or beliefs into a form that suits the Unseelie Court, and especially [[Dionaea]]'s needs.

Flint's pact with [[Dionaea]] has given him some dominion over the forces of fate and chance, in part thanks to his longstanding relationship with chance via gambling. Thematically, this reflects Flint's desire to have control over his own fate. Having spent his life with others expectations looming over him, he craves control, but his way of gaining it has left him dancing on Dionaea's puppet strings.

## Roleplaying
 - **Wants and Needs:** Flint wants nothing more than to be free to do as he pleases, causing some trouble and making others laugh. However, now that he owes his life to the Unseelie, he works for their goals, including their expansionism. However, he also wants to change their ways from the inside, always looking to find less violent solutions to problems. 
 - **Secret or Obstacle:** 
	 - Flint is pacted to Dionaea, who aims to unite all Fae under her Unseelie banner. Flint is not looking for a way out of his pact, as doing so would require losing both his Seelie and Unseelie powers, reducing him to a demi-fae humanoid, which he despises the thought of.
	 - Dionaea promised Flint that he would see Calendula again, which he thought impossible after finding out about [[Androticus]].
 - **Carrying:** A human's metal locket with a sketch of Calendula and Flint inside, taken when they were in disguise in a human settlement, a redwood carving of a flower.

## Involvement
[[Flint Reverie]] is a Cultural Ambassador, responsible for communicating with "grey zone" Fae, pushing Unseelie goals forward by appealing to their shared cultural roots as Fae. His job is to make first contact with a neutral faction like the [[Magram Tribe]], acting as the friendly face of the Unseelie Court in the region. 

[[Flint Reverie]] was deployed to Bromzheath to convince the [[Centuar Tribe]] to raze the town of [[Bromzheath]] during their [[High Hunt]], planning to capture [[Firbolg]] to use as warriors for the Unseelie effort, while killing those that don't comply. In addition, the chaos would allow the [[Unseelie Court|Unseelie]] to invade the [[Honeydrop Hall]], kill [[Ethereal Song]], and seize the treasures he stole from [[Dionaea]]. In Flint justifies this to himself as the first step in unification, forcing the Firbolgs under the banner is a necessary evil.

## Connections
### Players:
- [[Calendula Serenada]]: Childhood best friend, perhaps the subject of her crush. Flint wishes for Calendula to join him in the Unseelie, or at least to not distrust them as much, as he believes they are the force that can unify the Fae under one banner. 

### NPCs:
- [[Dionaea]]: Unseelie Queen and Flint's patron, providing him with incredible Fae power.
