## Backstory


## Connections

### Players:
- [[Lucian Castemur Duskwood]]: The Ashford family and the Duskwoods have always hated each other, especially Desmond and [[Felix Duskwood]], Lucian's father. Right before the blast that obliterated [[Androticus]], Lucian's family was being apprehended on crimes the Duskwood family had fabricated, or perhaps not. 
- [[Zod Byldamur]]: Zod has a personal hatred for [[Desmond Ashford]]. After Desmond's affair with [[Kotiri Byldamur]], he forced her to flee the city in secret, leaving Zod without his younger sister. Now that he knows why she left, Zod resents Desmond for abandoning his and Kotiri's children, [[Jak Byldamur-Ashford|Jak]] and [[Maia Byldamur-Ashford|Maia]]. Zod says its "on sight" with Desmond

### NPCs:
