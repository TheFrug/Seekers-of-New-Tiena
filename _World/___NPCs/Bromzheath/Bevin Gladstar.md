## Summary

[[Bevin Gladstar]] is a [[Firbolg]] who has more devotion to a different spirit of agriculture ([[Airmed]])than [[Chauntea]], who is revealed to be their patron, a Fey named Airmed who spent her life helping mortals with medicine for her tricks. They might know of a cure for Malachi's lycanthropy, but they will have to find it in a dangerous creature's nest.

[[Bevin Gladstar]] had a [[Fey]] friend named [[Airmed]], a beautiful [[Seelie Court|Seelie]] pixie who devoted her life to herbalism, learning the medicinal and poisoning properties of 365 different herbs across [[Tiena]]. She became Bevin Gladstar's patron on a whim, and while Bevin has been provided the powers of a low-level warlock, they have lost touch with these since Airmed became impossible to reach.

Merric's compost farm has been helpful to [[Bevin Gladstar]]'s garden ever since Clungunford stopped consecrating it. This might help the players convince them to testify.
