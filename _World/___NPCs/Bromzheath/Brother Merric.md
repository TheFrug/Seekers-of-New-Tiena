# Brother Merric

## Description
- **Name:** Brother Merric
- **Race/Species:** Halfling
- **Gender:** Male
- **Age:** 30s
- **Occupation/Class:** Cleric (Domain of Death)
- **Affiliation:** [[Church of Chauntea]], [[Cult of Talona]] (previous)

- **Appearance:** Shaggy hair that covers his eyes, earthen brown robes fastened with a rose pin. Has a thin moustache and slightly sharp fingernails

## Summary
Brother Merric is a devout cleric who lives under the [[Church of Chauntea]] in [[Bromzheath]]. Merric is a [[wererat]], having gained lycanthropy during his time in the [[Cult of Talona]]. However, Merric has no loyalty to the plaguemother, and instead devotes himself to attonement through his devotion to Chauntea. Merric has drawn suspicion from more ignorant Firbolgs, such as [[Baron Clungunford Rose]], but is ultimately a good person.

## Roleplaying
 - **Wants and Needs:** Rescue [[Pastor Edith]], Research cool decay plants, and use his findings to improve the lives of Bromzheath, and especially [[Pastor Edith]]
 - **Secret or Obstacle:** Is a wererat (now everyone knows lol)
 - **Significant Flaw:** Merric is guided by his heart, but even more so by fear. If [[Bromzheath]] stops being a safe place for Merric, he could easily fall back into his old life in the cult.
 - **Carrying:**


## Backstory
Merric started life in a sewer, living in the diseased [[Temple of Talona]] for the first decades of his life. Starting from a young age, Merric was taught the teachings of [[Talona]], the plaguemother, how pestilence and rot were her punishment for an ignorant populace. The mere thought of Talona struck fear in Merric's heart, and so he took his religious studies culminating in his willing participation in a ritual to become a [[Wererat]], which was thought to bring a devout closer to Talona.

After many years living amongst cultists of [[Talona]], and growing increasingly disgusted with his monstrous transformation, Merric grew disillusioned with the teachings of the plaguemother, and saw the healing potential in the plantlife that grew from decay. While the warriors were out gathering herbs, Merric fled the pestilent tomb he grew up in to find a new life. 

Settling in [[Bromzheath]], Merric was subject of both curiosity and suspicion from the native [[Firbolg|Firbolgs]] of Bromzheath. This came to an end (at least publicly) precisely when [[Pastor Edith]] took Brother Merric in as a cleric of [[Chauntea]]. Merric was moved to tears by Edith's sermons, and was granted a home in the basement of the church, where he would grow mushrooms and other corpse flowers with help from Edith.

## Connections


### Players:
**The Party:** Brother Merric met the party shortly after their arrival in Bromzheath. He quickly explained to them his past as a wererat and the presence of the [[Cult of Talona]] near Bromzheath. After the [[memory bolt]] incident with Pastor Edith, Merric stayed behind and kept the church closed while the party went to Clungunford, allowing the Cult of Talona to attack in the night, kidnapping Pastor Edith to use in a ritual.

The next day, the party testified in Brother Merric's defense during the trial of Brother Merric. Despite his unwanted transformation, the party was able to convince the elders that he was instrumental to the party locating the [[Temple of Talona]]. He is now assigned as the party's guide on their next mission.

### NPCs:

**[[Baron Clungunford Rose]]:** Clungunford has never treated Merric with much respect, and this only got worse after Edith's kidnapping. Clungunford tried every manipulative trick in the book to ensure that Merric would be found guilty and exiled, hoping he would take the fall for the attack on Pastor Edith, which Clungunford had orchestrated alongside the Cult of Talona.
