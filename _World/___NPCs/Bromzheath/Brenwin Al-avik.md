## Backstory


## Connections


### Players:
- [[Zod Byldamur]]: During the Bulette attack that occurred on the night [[Pastor Edith]] was kidnapped, some of [[Brenwin Al-avik]]'s beloved [[Al-Qonidarian Zebra]] broke free from the caravan and ran away. In an impressive use of his wild magic power, Zod teleported to one of the Zebras and lifted them up, carrying them safely back to the caravan. Brenwin rewarded this act of heroism with a [[Bantium Sander]] 
- [[The party]]: After the bulette attack, [[Brenwin Al-avik]] became an ally of the party, providing them a 30% discount on Caravan wares as well as a [[Sun Medallion]], which will come in handy if they find themselves in [[Al-Qonidar]]

### NPCs:

- [[Clungunford Rose]]: Invited to [[Clungunford's Party]] to strike up a deal providing weapons in exchange for [[Bromzheath]]'s food
- [[Lucian Castemur Duskwood]] has recommended that Brenwin avoid eating the feast
