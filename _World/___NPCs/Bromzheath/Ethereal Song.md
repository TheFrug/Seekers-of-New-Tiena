# Ethereal Song

## Description
- **Name:** Ethereal Song
- **Race/Species:** [[Fae]]
- **Gender:** Male
- **Age:** It’s rude to ask, darling
- **Occupation/Class:** Bartender, Noble
- **Affiliation:** [[Bromzheath]], [[Unseelie Court]]
- **Alignment:** Chaotic Neutral
- **Appearance:** A young-seeming sylvan of short height and handsome, yet delicate features. His glassy eyes, curled ear tips, and not-so-subtle stained-glass wings betray him to be fae.

## Summary
Flitting about the colorful and lively [[Honeydrop Hall]] is a beautiful bartender who is as quick with a smile as he is to pour you a mug of his special brew, [[Pale Cypress]].

Ethereal was a prince of the Unseelie Court before his exile, which came about due to his opposition to the Unseelie’s increasingly violent and expansionist tendencies. That’s the story he tells others, anyways. In reality, Ethereal raided the court’s coffers of fae treasure, which are as enriching as they are dangerous. 

These days, Ethereal enjoys the eternal party of his creation, the Honeydrop, of which he is the proprietor and bartender.

## Roleplaying
 - **Wants and Needs:** Run the [[Honeydrop Hall]] to the best of his abilities, nurturing the budding party scene in Bromzheath.
 - **Secret or Obstacle:** The [[Unseelie Court]] is aware that Ethereal Song is alive, and they want their treasure back. They also want to kill him.
 - **Carrying:** A beautiful flower of all colors in pristine condition (the key to Ethereal Song’s fortune)


## Involvement
- Currently holds a hoard of unseelie treasure below the Honeydrop and uses these treasures to work his luxurious magic.
