# Fiona

## Description
- **Name:** Fiona
- **Race/Species:** [[Firbolg]]
- **Gender:** Female
- **Age:** ~17
- **Occupation/Class:** Herbalist (in training)
- **Affiliation:** [[Bromzheath]]
- **Alignment:** Chaotic Neutral
- **Appearance:** Dark apron with cute patches sewn in and a pocket full of cigarettes. Auburn hair covers her face with its tangles, and smells faintly of sage.

## Summary

A moody Firbolg who begrudgingly lives in the [[Church of Chauntea]]'s orphanage. Fiona spends most of her time with her herbology teacher, [[Bevin Gladstar]], who has been something of a guardian to her since the passing of Fiona's parents, who died of a mysterious illness that spread from their crops.


## Roleplaying
 - **Wants and Needs:** 
 - **Secret or Obstacle:**
	 - Fiona's parents didn't die naturally: they were poisoned. She knows they died from someone poisoning her family's crops, but keeps it hush so no one outs her.
	 - What she doesn't know: [[Clungunford Rose]] poisoned her family farm of recreational plants as he disapproved of their effect on [[Bromzheath]]'s people. He did this via Talona cult poison. He says he only intended to ruin their crop, and did not know they maintained edible crops as well as smokable. Still a shitty dangerous thing to do.
 - **Carrying:**
