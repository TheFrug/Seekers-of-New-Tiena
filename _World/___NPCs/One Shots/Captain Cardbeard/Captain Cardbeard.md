## Summary

Captain Cardbeard is a foolhardy and silly captain. He flies the flag of Carreg Ynes, an island of hardy dwarves, but curiously doesn't fly a coalition flag. His beard is respectably braided, and adorned with aces of various suits as embellishments. He wears a cardboard tricorn and a large black fur cape.

Cardbeard's most recent ventures have been sorry ones. He lost a respectable chunk of his crew "procuring" a valuable magical artefact, the [[Geas of the Horned King]]. On the voyage home, his two-ship crew stopped at Littlerock Island. While there, he drunkenly sailed his main ship, "Cardbeard's Ace" around the island, and ended up having it swallowed by a massive whale: Booga-Booga. He escaped the ship by jumping overboard, and in a fit of panic, sailed his other ship, "She Got the House" away from the island, with only Cookie the cook and Jobs Steve remaining.
