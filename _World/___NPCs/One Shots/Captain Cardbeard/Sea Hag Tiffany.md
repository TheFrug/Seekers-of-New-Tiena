- **Occupation/Class:** 
- **Affiliation:** [[Istalean Sea]], [[Cult of Booga-Booga]]

## Summary

Tiffany is a Sea Hag living in the Istalean Sea. She takes the disguise of a Kuo-Toa Shaman to control the Cult of Booga-Booga, which operates inside, outside, and around the massive mystical whale [[Booga-Booga]]. 

Using the [[Geas of the Horned King]], Tiffany manipulated Booga-Booga to do her bidding, mind body and soul. She event went so far as to convert the beautiful beast into a Lair, a base of operations from which to study and cast her magics.

The Kuo-Toa, who worship Booga-Booga, trust their Archpriest (Tiffany in a magical disguise), who tells them to sift through the swallowed ships for treasure, and to bring all the sailors and villagers they can find back to the whale to enslave them. 

This was all going swimmingly, with [[Littlerock Island]] nearly wiped out before four adventurers came along to put a stop to Tiffany's villainy and recover the Geas, which their employer, [[Captain Cardbeard]], had lost some weeks earlier.

    desc: "The hag can breath air and water" 
  - name: Horrific Appearance
    desc: "Any humanoid that starts its turn within 30 feet of the hag and can see the hag's true form must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the hag is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag's Horrific Appearance for the next 24 hours. Unless the target is surprised or the revelation of the hag's true form is sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid making the initial saving throw. Until the start of its next turn, a creature that averts its eyes has disadvantage on attack rolls against the hag."

  - name: Illusory Appearance
    desc: "The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like an ugly creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The effect ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies. The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no claws, but someone touching her hand might feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised."
