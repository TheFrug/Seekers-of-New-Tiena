A massive, like really massive whale living in the [[Istalean Sea]]. A gentle creature by nature, Booga-Booga came to harm others when under the influence of the [[Geas of the Horned King]], a powerful relic that allows users to control anything pierced by the Geas. The [[Sea Hag Tiffany]] thrust the Geas in Booga-Booga's heart, converting him from a peaceful dopy whale into a violent machine serving her domination of the Istalean Sea.
