# Dungeon: Temple of Talona

## Backstory
The Temple of Talona is the final bastion of worship for the Mother of Plagues: [[Talona]]. For millennia, [[Cult of Talona|the Talontar]] lived in secret devotion, with its members spread out in a network of temples and traveling clergy all committed to promoting Talona and studying disease and poisons. However, as Talona was slain early into the [[War of the Gods]], she stopped answering her people’s calls, depowering their clerics and essentially dissolving their faith, as the world went centuries without the Plaguemother’s wrath.

As such, the Temple of Talona near [[Bromzheath]], which had historically been one of the most important worship sites of Talona, plunged into cultship, as its members feverishly tried to create a perfect plague and unleash it upon Bromzheath, believing that Talona’s abandonment of them was a punishment for their lack of service ([[Brother Merric]] fled the cult around this time). This all came to a head when the [[Ratmancer]] kidnapped the firbolg [[Pastor Edith]] for use in a ritual to bring about a plague with the potential to revive Talona herself.

## Start & Goal
- Hook: Brother Merric has led the party to the hidden Temple of Talona. The party can talk about their pre-dungeon prep in flashbacks.
	- Clungunford handed the party a envelope with a boar seal. He instructed the party to hand it to the cultists if diplomacy seemed possible, and that it might sway them without bloodshed.
- Goal / what ends the crawl: Find Pastor Edith and bring her back to Bromzheath while ensuring her safety.

## Secrets
- This temple's history shows that other than the regular cultists, there were once frequent visitors from those making offerings of appeasement to [[Talona]]. These appeasement visitations ceased sometime after Talona's death, which led to plagues declining across [[Tiena]]. After that, only the already unscrupulous [[Cult of Talona]] remained to worship her.
	- (Religion 15) All altars come in pairs, one to belay plague, and one to evoke plague. The evoking altars are clean and show signs of use, but the belaying altars are all in states of extreme decay. 
- The [[Cult of Talona]] has been working for [[Baron Clungunford Rose]] for years. However, having caught onto Clungunford's plan to arm the [[Bromzheath Militia]] via trade deal with [[Brenwin's Caravan]], they have decided now is the time to set their plan into motion
	- The note [[Baron Clungunford Rose|Clungunford]] gave the party to give to the Cultists reads: ""
- The next step in the [[Cult of Talona]]'s big plan is to take back the [[Decanter of Unending Filth]] that Clungunford took as collateral.

### Party-Specific
- [[Zod Byldamur|Zod]]: 
- [[Lucian Castemur Duskwood|Lucian]]: The **lab** has a book in it with the Duskwood family crest. This book, written by [[Harken Duskwood]], details best practices for death domain cleric rituals, and has a characteristic pompous writing similar to that of [[Isadora Duskwood]]
- [[Malachi]]: The temple was visited by a lone [[Tellers|Teller]], who took it upon himself to travel the continent informing temples of the truth: that some of the gods are dead, and have been for many years. This Teller, [[Joachim]], was medically tortured to death by the [[Cult of Talona]] for spreading what they saw as heresy.
- [[Calendula Serenada|Calendula]]: [[Ratmancer]] perceives Calendula as an [[Unseelie Court|Unseelie]] Fae because of her [[Redwood Panpipes]]
