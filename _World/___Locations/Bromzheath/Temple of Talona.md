# Dungeon: Temple of Talona

## Backstory
The Temple of Talona is the final bastion of worship for the Mother of Plagues: [[Talona]]. For millennia, [[Cult of Talona|the Talontar]] lived in secret devotion, with its members spread out in a network of temples and traveling clergy all committed to promoting Talona and studying disease and poisons. However, as Talona was slain early into the [[War of the Gods]], she stopped answering her people’s calls, depowering their clerics and essentially dissolving their faith, as the world went centuries without the Plaguemother’s wrath.

As such, the Temple of Talona near [[Bromzheath]], which had historically been one of the most important worship sites of Talona, plunged into cultship, as its members feverishly tried to create a perfect plague and unleash it upon Bromzheath, believing that Talona’s abandonment of them was a punishment for their lack of service ([[Brother Merric]] fled the cult around this time). This all came to a head when the [[Ratmancer]] kidnapped the firbolg [[Pastor Edith]] for use in a ritual to bring about a plague with the potential to revive Talona herself.
