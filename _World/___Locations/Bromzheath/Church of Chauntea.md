In the center of town, built near cobblestone roads and sticking out next to its more contemporary neighbors is the Church of Chauntea. The building is made entirely from wood, with a layer of grass and flowers growing all over it, save for its beautiful painted murals of the Earthmother.

The interior has three main sections: the worship area, Edith's Office, and the kitchen, as well as a hatch leading into Merric's hovel

### Worship Area

The main entryway to the Church leads into the Worship Area, which is a wide hall with two columns of humble wooden pews contrasted against the elegant stained-glass mural of The Earthmother, [[Chauntea]], who is depicted as a beautiful woman who just screams "mom". In the back left corner of the area is a hatch covered by the end of a long carpet. This hatch leads into [[Brother Merric]]'s underground hovel.

### Edith's Office

The east wing is an l-shaped hallway. On the long section are a few curtains leading to private prayer rooms/confession booths, while at the end of the short section, around a corner, is the door to Edith's office. 

 - Inside the office, the (false) [[False Earthmotherâ€™s Scythe|Earthmother's Scythe]] hangs on a mural that can be seen from the square-shaped carved in the door.
 - Turning right, there is a stained-glass window depicting [[Chauntea]], now with more bovine features, slicing a gaunt woman ([[Talona]]) in half. Under the windowsill is a small garden of flowers and a few spices. 
 - Across the room there is a large bed, a nightstand with a prayer journal, and a small sack of apples with a quote woven in cursive reading: "Blessed by the Snackmother!"

## Seedbank

The left wing of the Church ends in a large door that leads into a shed with elephant-sized entrances leading outside. This is the Seedbank, an important function of [[Bromzheath]]'s community. Chauntea's faithful are encouraged to bring excess seed to the Seedbank to be distributed to those in need. The Seedbank is organized with shelves, and has wooden floors so that the seeds don't accidentally bury themselves inside the shed.

## Orphanage

An orphanage full of fuzzy little firbolg kids! There is also an elf kid with a crushed leg who was healed by [[Malachi]], as well as an adorable gnome kiddo who's parents were crushed by elephants.
