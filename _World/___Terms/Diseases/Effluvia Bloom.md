Effluvia Bloom is a [[Disease]] created by the [[Cult of Talona]] as a form of biological warfare. It is carried in the blood and fur of their rats, as well as in the blood of many members of the cult. 

### Effects

- Until the disease is cured, infected can't regain hit points except by magical means, and their hit point maximum decreases by 3 (1d6) every 24 hours. If the target's hit point max drops to 0 as a result of this disease, they die
- Effluvia Bloom has a rapid incubation, with the heal-block effect taking place almost instantly after contraction. The effects worsen over time, and can be fatal if left untreated for many days.

### Symptoms

- 1st 24 hours: Itchy, reddened skin
- 2nd 24 hours: Itchiness intensifies, making the character scratch their itch whenever they aren't consciously trying not to
- 3rd 24 hours: boils on skin
- 4th: it gets worse, ok. Don't let it get this bad
