# Wererat
*Source: SRD 5.2*  

## Wererat

*Changed by the Deviousness of the Rat*

- **Habitat.** Forest, Urban  
- **Treasure.** Individual  

Wererats can shape-shift from their humanoid forms into giant rats or humanoid-rat hybrids. These creatures can transform voluntarily, but some are magically compelled to shape-shift when exposed to complete darkness, during nights of a new moon, or at the command of a powerful [[Ratmancer]]. Often, wererats' nature results from a divine blessing from evil-aligned gods like [[Talona]], or as a curse from benevolent gods for crimes. Wererats are an important part of the [[Cult of Talona]], but rogue Wererats have been known to form/lead gangs of bandits

## Lycanthropy

If a wererat transmits lycanthropy through a bite, the target becomes a 'dormant' wererat. The most impactful symptoms at this stage is a craving for cheese.
Their full transformation occurs under the next full moon or when a Ratmancer commands it, although a Ratmancer can only transform someone it knows is a Wererat.

### Cures/Treatment
- Wererat lycanthropy can be cured by the divine might of healing gods such as [[Ra]]. 
- Dormant/weak lycanthropy can also be cured via herbal remedy involving a ritual using the blood of the lycanthrope who sired.
	- [[Bevin Gladstar]] knows how to do it
