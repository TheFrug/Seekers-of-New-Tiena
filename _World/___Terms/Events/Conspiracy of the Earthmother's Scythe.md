### Summary
[[Clungunford Rose]]'s plan to convert [[Bromzheath]] into a monarchy, crowning himself as its first king. 

### Background
Using his lineage as part of the Rose bloodline, [[Clungunford Rose]] can use the [[Earthmother's Scythe]] to its fullest potential. This is traditionally used by the head of the Rose family to consecrate fields, making their harvests fuller.


### Goals
- Centralize the power of the [[Earthmother's Scythe]] to [[Clungunford Rose]] by eliminating its steward, [[Pastor Edith]], who holds the power to destroy and recreate the Scythe.
- Selectively utilize the [[Earthmother's Scythe]] to secretly reward allies and punish community members that stray too far from the conservative traditions, such as [[Bevin Gladstar]] and her herbal remedies, or [[Fiona]]'s parents and their recreational plants. 
- Instill a distrust of outsiders and sense of national/ethnic pride in the [[Firbolg]]
- Achieve a trade deal with [[Brenwin Al-avik]] and his caravan to begin amassing arms and materials from [[Al Qonidar]] in order to concentrate military might among the gentry of [[Bromzheath]]
