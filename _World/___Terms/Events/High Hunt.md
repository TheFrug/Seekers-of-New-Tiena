A long period of herd travel performed every 81 years by the centaurs of the [[Magram Tribe]]. The herd gallops through the lands touched by Malar, which are rife with massive predators and prey. Along the way, the Magram Tribe slaughters and eats all in its path, celebrating the liberty that Malar gives to his blood-soaked devotees.

### Significance
This event will soon take the Magram Tribe through [[Bromzheath]]. If they aren't stopped, this could mean incredible bloodshed for the [[Firbolg]] of Bromzheath
