*Fist-worn weapon*, Uncommon (requires attunement by a monk)*  
These enchanted wraps made of magically woven spider silk, sheer and light but durable. While wearing these wraps, you can unspool them to make special unarmed strikes with a reach of 15ft.
These unarmed strikes do no damage, but if you hit a creature no more than one size larger than you, you can attempt to grapple and pull it up to 10 feet toward you using your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) check. Once on each of your turns, you can instead use the wraps to replicate the effects of a successful attack with a net 
As an action, you can fire the wrappings up to 30 feet away, anchoring them against a solid mass (such as walls or trees), a heavy object, or surfaces (such as walls, floors, and ceilings). As part of the same action, you can retract the wrappings, pulling you in to the closest unoccupied space that is adjacent to your anchor, or use the wrappings to swing yourself to another point within 30 feet of the anchor if it is attached to a ceiling. Alternatively, you can detach and anchor the other end instead, allowing creatures to climb across the length of wrapping at full movement speed.
The material is strong enough to support up to 500lbs, has an AC of 17, and has 25 hit points.

Right now, I want to flesh it out to add some extra conflict. [[Malachi]], lost his entire [[Xenobium]] in the Sundering of [[Androticus]], an event that killed millions including the entire party (now resurrected to hunt for treasure in exchange for having their lives back). He just found the corpse of a dwarven Teller in the [[Cult of Talona]]'s dungeon, and retrieved a magic item, Silksail, from it. I want this dead Teller to be part of a splintered Xenobium that caught onto a huge discovery (that the Gods who created [[Tiena]] and its people did so as an experiment, and that they were the ones who caused the Sundering of Androticus because scholars and mages were getting too close to figuring out how to travel to the plane of the Gods.) This dead Teller and his group split up to learn more from religious groups so they could reconvene and discuss their findings. How can I tie this into the story for Malachi? He is going to attune with Silksail at some point soon, and when he does I want it to magically impart some of this history onto him.

### History
- Silksail was the signature equipment of the dwarvish [[Teller|Teller]], [[Durin the Lash]]. Durin's [[Splinter Xenobium|Xenobium]] came across [[Androticus]] a short time after the Sundering, and began to investigate. Being one of the first groups there, they found a magically-protected [[Textbook]] that survived the total annihilation of the city. This text held research notes relating to accessing the [[Realm of Gods]], but the [[Teller]] were unable to read it. As such, they split up to learn more from religious groups, and planned to reconvene 10 years hence. [[Durin the Lash]] made critical discoveries about [[Talona]] and the [[Umbral Conclave]]
