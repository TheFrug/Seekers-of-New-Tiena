Magic panpipes gifted to [[Calendula Serenada]] by [[Janaff]]. It plays beautifully to Calendula's ear, as well as to other [[Unseelie Court]] fae, but shrill and off-key to anyone else.

**Effects:** 
- Provides +2 to the spell save DC of spells cast using these panpipes as a magical focus. 
- [[Unseelie Court]] [[Fae]] gain advantage to saving throws made against spells cast using these panpipes as a magical focus
- Whenever being played, in the flower that grows from the longest reed on the panpipes, an insect-like eye opens and provides [[Dionaea]] vision and hearing of the surroundings
- Allows [[Dionaea]] to access Calendula's dreams and even speak to her remotely
