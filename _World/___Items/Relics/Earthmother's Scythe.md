Relic of [[Chauntea]], the Earthmother. The Earthmother’s scythe is a limber scythe with a wooden handle, a dull blade, and a beautiful rose at his head. 

The true relic is currently in the possession of [[Clungunford Rose]], but a [[False Earthmother’s Scythe|Replica]] of diminished power sits in [[Pastor Edith]]’s office in the [[Church of Chauntea]]. 

According to [[Pastor Edith]], the scythe can be created again if destroyed via ritual that costs 50 years of life. 
If stolen, the scythe can be made to detonate and reform remotely for some reason? This only costs 5 years of life.

It can consecrate land, enriching its soil, or even cut open a portal to a faraway land that celebrates Chauntea as well.
