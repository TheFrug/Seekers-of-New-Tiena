## Overview
- **Type**: Collective of adventurers
- **Reputation**: None so far, and Bridget aims to keep it that way
- **Aesthetic**: A rag-tag bunch. Quite literally the most diverse collective in [[Tiena]].
- **Symbol/Icon**: Raven brand tattoo to be able to identify members (optional)
## Leadership & Power Structure
- **Leader**: [[Captain Bridget]]
- **Power Structure**:

Bridget calls the shots. Her first mate [[Elbo Greece]] has authority in her absence. Past that, the rest of the camp is a community effort. Other than within jobs, there are no hierarchies at play, and the collective works together to survive and thrive.

Of course, Seeker’s Roost is meant to surge a purpose: to facilitate the discovery and acquisition of relics. As such, the members of Seeker’s roost have certain tasks allotted to them.

- **Seekers:** The namesake of the camp, the Seekers are formed into squads of 4-5. These squads are dispatched great distances across [[Tiena]] with the help of [[Earl]] and his [[Flatback Longstrider]]. The Seekers’ one goal is to recover whatever relic is located in the area and return it to Bridget
- **Workforce:** Living in Seeker’s Roost is a collective of people with a variety of specialized skills. Together, they form the vital organs of Seeker’s Roost, from construction workers to cooks. 
- **Operation Team:** Some members of the camp serve a primarily operational role, acting in service of the mission at the expense of rather than production of resources. These include [[Rhemus Quilbeard|librarians]], [[Seeker Scout|scouts]], etc.
- **Base of Operations:** [[Seeker's Roost]], a camp built in secret, atop a cliff overlooking [[Androticus]]’s crater
