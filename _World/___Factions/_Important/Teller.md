An order of monks who travel around [[Tiena]] observing history as it unfolds. Tellers are grouped into [[Xenobium]] with each Xenobium being led by an [[abbott]]. Tellers believe in the spoken word over written language, and take efforts to avoid literacy as they believe that thanks to human deceit and magic that writing cannot be trusted. The [[Teller]] maintain the history of Tiena orally, as the long-lived members of each Xenobium pass their experience and knowledge to newcomers over long periods. However, as a rule, Tellers do not interfere with the course of history, as they view themselves as spectators, entirely third-party to the histories of the societies they observe.

Tellers wear a pin crafted from resources local to wherever that Teller started their journey as a [[Teller]]. Despite differences in material, [[Teller]] pins can be easily recognized by their shape and the magic used to create them.
