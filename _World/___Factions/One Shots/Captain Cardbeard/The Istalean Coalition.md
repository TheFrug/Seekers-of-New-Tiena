The Istalean Coalition is the multi-state trade organization that standardizes measurements, currency, and valuation for island-states within the [[Istalean Sea]]. While the Coalition's rules define the conduct of travel on the seas, their jurusdiction does not extend to the islands themselves. The Coalition started out as a trade union, as sailors and merchants from all over the sea organized together to demand to each of their island leaders that it was the folk of the sea who should determine how interstate trade is conducted. The Coalition created "[[The Code]]", a living set of maritime rules followed and enforced by Coalition states.
