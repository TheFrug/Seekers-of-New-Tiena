A collection of [[Gods]] who came together to fight the [[Umbral Conclave]] as they executed their power-grab. The Reckoners are not necessarily the good Gods to counter the Umbral Conclave's evil. Rather, the Reckoners were made up of gods who:
1. Were powerful enough (measured in mortal worship) to participate in the fight
2. Had their rank threatened by the [[Umbral Conclave]]
