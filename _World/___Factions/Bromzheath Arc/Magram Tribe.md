## Leadership & Power Structure
- **Leader**: [[Garmos Anth-Malar]]
- **Power Structure**:
  - Alpha Horse: Leads and protects the herd. Often a strong, dominant figure
  - Wardens: Herd strategists, responsible for directing the herd's travel to new sources of food/water. Wardens lead scout troops, handle negotiations with other civilizations, and in general take on the more stressful tasks so their herdmates can focus on the hunt
	  - [[Sleuf Softmane]]
  - Others: Partake in the hunt, can act as desired
- **Base of Operations**: No centralized home, but the Magram tribe travels anywhere there is open space to see prey as well as potential predators. Right now, the Magram Tribe is staying near an [[Unseelie Court]] encampment a few dozen miles from Bromzheath.

## Goals
- **Primary Objective**: Complete [[The High Hunt]]
- **Long-Term Agenda**: Survive while appeasing the god of the hunt, [[Malar]]
- **Current Activities**: Talking to the [[Unseelie Court]], specifically [[Flint Reverie]].

## Means
- **Tactics**: Primitive weapons meets remarkable coordination and agility.
- **Assets**: (Notable resources like magical items, creatures, allies, wealth)
- **Allies & Rivals**:
  - Rivals: [[Ebenezer's Pack]] of werehumans, who, as devotees of Malar, see the centaurs as fair game (literally!)

## Members
- **Demographic:** Centaurs
- **Culture & Values**: 
	- Malar Worship: The [[Magram Tribe]] worships the bestial god of the hunt and savagery, [[Malar]]. Malar is a violent god who relishes the bloody slaughter of prey, and expects the same of his followers.
	- In the Magram Tribe, slaying the young, elderly, or sick is seen as an insult to Malar, who graced the Centaur with the means to hunt worthy prey
	- **Important:** Malar is worshipped to some degree by all in the tribe, but is unpopular among some for his brutality. Still, the alpha Mare of the Tribe is also always the most devoted to Malar.
  - [[Reynauld Stonehoof]]: Nearly perished in the T-Rex attack, but was saved by the party. Allowed [[Lucian Castemur Duskwood]] to ride atop him as a show of gratitude and respect. 

## Hooks & Notes
- **Adventure Hooks**: (Ways the party might get involved)
- **Secrets**: (Hidden goals, betrayals, forbidden knowledge)
- **DM Notes**: The centaur tribe has been in contact with agents of the [[Unseelie Court]] for some time. [[Flint Reverie]] specifically has done a lot to convince the leader of the tribe, [[Garmos Anth-malar]], that the centaur must trample [[Bromzheath]] down during [[The High Hunt]], rather than simply path around it as some are suggesting (like [[Sleuf Softmane]])
