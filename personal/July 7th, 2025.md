I am on acid with my beautiful partner Rez right now. I wish I could paint what I see in images but things are so clear. Every key I type on my keyboard lights up a row of sparkling lights which feels really nice right now. 

This is all going to be really funny to me in any amount of time, really

I'm not used to freewriting. My thoughts kind of just stop being my thoughts and go into nothingness??? I guess that's where they go when I'm done? I don't know I don't write them down I just think them and the next moment they're gone. I sometimes feel like my consciousness is just like this. Like TEXT

BLAHBLAHBLAH

Can't even type "blah" properly like I want to bnecause I'm trying to paint with words and it's hard because I'm so concerned with everything I write being perfect and beautiful and CORRECT Like someone else will look at them and tell me I am correct. 

I just cried and Rez turned back the music on which is a blurry ass recording of the Blue Oyster Cult playing Don't Fear the Reaper and its so multimedia its kind of crazy. The man is alone on that stage playing this ear-splitting guitar solo and I'm just typing as fast as I can to keep the thoughts on the page. This solo IS SO FUCKING GOOD. ITS SO FUCKING GOOD IM TYPING WITHOUT EVEN LOOKINGGGGGG.

I stare at the Priest of Titania that Rez altered for me for my 21st birthday. I can see the incredible detail and the tiny differences in the texture of the card between the parts that Rez drew themselves and the  part printed on the card. Like the slightly coarse 

I can appreciate how the magic card, the artwork in my hand, is also an emotionally valuable game piece that holds memories ephemerally.

You know your brain is mostly made of fat? Most of what it's made of is the grey matter um. the hell is it? Its not fat? Well it stores it in that shit. So when it breaks itself down and access it itll come back if you have too much of it in your brain. That's what leads people to bad trips, you know? Be careful about [[frequency]], because

Temper expectations, temper yourself, 100micrograms feels like a lot, you guys haven't disassociated or experienced ego-death right? Right! I think we've been pretty in the moment. Its been a different kind of in-the-moment. Like every sensation is maybe not stronger because that would be overwhelming for me, but rather that they all kind of.... I can so easily switch to focus on a specific sensation. 4-5 hrs in is supposed to be when ego-death should have happened but its good we didnt! Ego Death is very **intense** and you lose a sense of yourself, just like Dad described. 

Mad jelly, I wanna be on acid right now

LSD doesn't get metabolized! It gets stored in the brain permanently. If you take too much, you can randomly have an episode where that part of your brain gets accessed, and just like that you're back in time in that moment where that trip was? Like imagine walking on the street and just being back on your living room floor tripping. That would obviously be bad. 

Cuz you were saying, you want to do this 'more'. Change that word 'more' out for '[[AGAIN]]'
