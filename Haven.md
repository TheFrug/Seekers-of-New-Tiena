Dotting the vast expanse of [[Tiena]] are numerous settlements that have managed to develop despite the harsh conditions. These *Havens* are the bastions of culture and society standing out against the untamed wilds, and are named as such because in order for a community to develop in such a dangerous land, the people must devise strategies to survive and thrive.
