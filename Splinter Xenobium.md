A [[Xenobium]] of [[Teller]] who discovered [[Androticus]] as a crater shortly after the Sundering. They were called their for an important meeting between [[Xenobium|Xenobiums]] including [[Malachi]] and [[Haggai|Haggai's]]. However, the Splinter Xenobium was too late.
These [[Teller]] searched the ruins and found a magically-laminated [[Textbook]] that contained the research notes of the scholars who almost reached the [[Realm of Gods]]. These [[Teller]] were unable to read the book, as it would be against their beliefs, but realized the significance of this discovery all the same. The [[Teller]] then split up to explore religious orders around [[Tiena]] individually for a 10 years before reconvening.
