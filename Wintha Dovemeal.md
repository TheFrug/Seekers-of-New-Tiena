## Summary
Wintha Dovemeal is a kind elder noble and one of [[Clungunford Rose]]'s most trusted advisors. Wintha was a teacher for many years and a lifetime friend of [[Pastor Edith]], and thus became enraged at Clungunford during [[Merric's Trial]], as Clungunford was not prioritizing Edith's safety. This led to Wintha becoming suspicious of her best friend's nephew, as he was showing more outwardly sinister behavior.

Wintha Dovemeal is attending the [[Rose Estate Ball]] out of necessity. She will be very happy to see [[Pastor Edith]] alive and well.

## Backstory
Wintha Dovemeal is a kind noble who stays connected to her territory's townsfolk. She is well-connected to the [[Rose Family]] through her longtime friendship with [[Pastor Edith]]. When [[Brave Rose]] was the chosen of [[Chauntea]], he encouraged the Dovemeal family to move close to the [[Rose Estate]]. This over time led to her family amassing land. 

While they are nobles, the Dovemeals have always been a family of teachers, so they have a strong sense of community. [[Pastor Edith]] introduced Witha Dovemeal to her late husband, who was a Priest of Chauntea. Later stepped on by an elephant. Very sad.
