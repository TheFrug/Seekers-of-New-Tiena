Godly Relics are powerful magical items created by the [[God|gods]] in order to link their power to the material plane. These come in many forms, such as
- Magical tools granted to devoted followers. These come with abilities that reflect the domain of the associated god in order to prove their existence. 
	- [[Earthmother's Scythe]]
	- [[Geas of the Horned King]]

Relics are imbued with power on their creation, and can only be destroyed via magical means. If the associated god dies, the Relic retains its powers, now unbound, allowing another god to harness that relic's abilities to expand their own godly portfolio.

[[Volke]], the Scavenger, is currently conducting a massive scavenger hunt unknowingly led by [[The Seekers of New Tiena]] to gather up the unclaimed relics left behind after the [[War of the Gods]]. This is the inflection point of a plan [[Volke]] has been cooking for thousands of years to gather enough strength to rule [[Tiena]] entirely, possible even ruling over the other [[God|gods]].
