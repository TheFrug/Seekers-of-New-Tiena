## Summary
Brave Rose is the last chieftain of the [[Bromzheath]] [[Firbolg]]. He led the Firbolgs out of the [[Unseelie]] [[Feywild]] they lived in, as the Firbolgs were under threat of punishment for their worship of [[Chauntea]], which was previously permitted for centuries prior. 

Once the [[Firbolg]] had settled in the rolling megafauna hills of [[Bromzheath]], Brave gave up his status as chieftain, as the people of [[Bromzheath]] were finally free from the political bullshit of the [[Unseelie Court]].
