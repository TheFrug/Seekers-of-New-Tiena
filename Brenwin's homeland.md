A desert country inhabited by Dragonborn and Human alike. This stems from early history, where the Dragonborn basked and relished the hot desert sun, but were defenseless at night, while the humans covered themselves from the heat, but were active at night. An early large settlement of dragonborn connected with a kind human settlement that offered to work together to ensure their mutual survival against the undead in the desert. It was awesome and they became super pals!
