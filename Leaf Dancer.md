# Leaf Dancer

## Description
- **Name:** Leaf Dancer
- **Race/Species:** [[Centaur]]
- **Gender:** Female
- **Age:** Slightly older
- **Occupation/Class:** Warrior
- **Affiliation:** [[Magram Tribe]]
- **Alignment:** [[Lawful Neutral]]
- **Appearance:** Pale-furred and white-eyed, Leaf Dancer is a centaur with the limber body of a doe. Her long, slender arms grip a glaive as long as she is tall, and she is tall. At the glaive's end is an ornate blade that shines like a mirror with three ribbons attached to its end. A trophy of a good hunt.

## Summary

Leaf Dancer is a respected warrior in the [[Magram Tribe]], defending the tribe against poachers and bandits. She takes no pleasure in bloodshed, but will make any sacrifice to save her clan.

Leaf Dancer is agile and dextrous, but her smaller size relative to her tribemates makes her more vulnerable to the massive beasts the Magram take pleasure in hunting. Still wanting to help her tribe, Leaf Dancer learned to fight those smaller than herself, outmaneuvering opponents while outwitting their superior technology.

Conflict: Leaf Dancer knows that if [[Clungunford Rose]] were to see the centaur, he would want to add them to his newly developing army.

## Roleplaying

	 - If she dies, Desmond Ashford will be able to warp to her body to retrieve a sample, and then can warp back
 - **Significant Flaw:**
