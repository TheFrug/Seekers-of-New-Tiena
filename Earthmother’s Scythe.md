Relic of [[Chauntea]], the Earthmother. The Earthmother’s scythe is a limber scythe with a wooden handle, a dull blade, and a beautiful rose at his head. 

The true relic is currently in the possession of [[Baron Clungunford Rose]], but a [[False Earthmother’s Scythe|Replica]] of diminished power sits in [[Pastor Edith]]’s office in the [[Church of Chauntea]].
