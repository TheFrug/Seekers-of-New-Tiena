A set of laws important to life in the [[Istalean Sea]]. Failure to follow its tenants brands one a pirate, which is quite the dishonor. The key tenents are as follows:

- **The Sea Belongs to None, is Governed by All**
	- No single island or power may claim ownership of the Sea. Sea lanes, neutral anchorages, and currents are public property, subject to Coalition oversight.
	- Claiming a lane or taxing passage without sanction is considered piracy
- **A Ship's Flag is its Law**
	- Internally, ships follow the laws of its registered island-state. Disputes between ships are resolved under The Code, meaning [[Istalean Coalition]] rules 
- **Aid Any in Distress, Regardless of Banner**
	- The Istalean Sea is a dangerous place. As such, humanity's survival is only assured if all coalition-flagged ships aid others in distress when need be. Trust is King
- **No Trade Shall be Obstructed Without Cause**
	- Harassment, arbitrary tariffs, blockades, or seizures of goods without Coalition adjudication are violations. The coalition can dole these things out
- **All Contracts Signed Under the Code are Binding Before the Sea and Stars**
	- Trade agreements, manifests, etc sworn under coalition carry weight of law.
	- Breach of such contracts invoked sanction and/or arbitration
- **Violence in Port is the Crime of Every Hand to Draw a Blade**
	- All coalition harbors are neutral ground. Violence in port is prosecuted collectively, regardless of who started it.
