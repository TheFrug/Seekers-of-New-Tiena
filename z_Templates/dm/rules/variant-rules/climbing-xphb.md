# Climbing
*Source: the Free Rules (2024)* 

While you're climbing, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in [difficult terrain](rules/variant-rules/difficult-terrain-xphb.md)). You ignore this extra cost if you have a [Climb Speed](rules/variant-rules/climb-speed-xphb.md) and use it to climb. At the DM's option, climbing a slippery surface or one with few handholds might require a successful DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check.
