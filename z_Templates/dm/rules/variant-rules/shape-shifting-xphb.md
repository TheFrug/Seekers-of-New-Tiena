# Shape-Shifting
*Source: the Free Rules (2024)* 

If an effect, such as Wild Shape or the [Polymorph](compendium/spells/polymorph-xphb.md) spell, lets you shape-shift, its description specifies what happens to you. Unless that description says otherwise, any ongoing effects on you—[conditions](rules/variant-rules/condition-xphb.md), spells, curses, and the like—carry over from one form to the other. You revert to your true form if you die.
