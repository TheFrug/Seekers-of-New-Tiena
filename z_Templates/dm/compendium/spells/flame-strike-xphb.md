A vertical column of brilliant fire roars down from above. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high Cylinder centered on a point within range makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking `5d6` Fire damage and `5d6` Radiant damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The Fire damage and the Radiant damage increase by `1d6` for each spell slot level above 5.

**Classes**: [Paladin (Oath of Devotion)](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-paladin-xphb-oath-of-devotion-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Cleric](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md)
