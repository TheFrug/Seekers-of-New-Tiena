# Darkness
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*2nd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, M (bat fur and a piece of coal)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

For the duration, magical [Darkness](rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md) spreads from a point within range and fills a 15-foot-radius Sphere. [Darkvision](rules/senses.md#Darkvision) can't see through it, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it.

Alternatively, you cast the spell on an object that isn't being worn or carried, causing the [Darkness](rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md) to fill a 15-foot Emanation originating from that object. Covering that object with something opaque, such as a bowl or helm, blocks the [Darkness](rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md).

If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of [Bright Light](rules/variant-rules/bright-light-xphb.md) or [Dim Light](rules/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) created by a spell of level 2 or lower, that other spell is dispelled.

**Classes**: [Wizard](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md); [Wizard (Evoker)](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard-xphb-evoker-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Warlock](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-warlock.md); [Sorcerer](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Bard](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Bard (College of Lore)](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-bard-xphb-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB")
