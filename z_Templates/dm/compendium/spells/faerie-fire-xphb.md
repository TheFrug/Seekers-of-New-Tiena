*1st-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Objects in a 20-foot Cube within range are outlined in blue, green, or violet light (your choice). Each creature in the Cube is also outlined if it fails a Dexterity saving throw. For the duration, objects and affected creatures shed [Dim Light](rules/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) in a 10-foot radius and can't benefit from the [Invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) condition.

[Attack](rules/actions.md#Attack) rolls against an affected creature or object have [Advantage](rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) if the attacker can see it.

**Classes**: [Bard](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Druid](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Bard (College of Lore)](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-bard-xphb-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB")
