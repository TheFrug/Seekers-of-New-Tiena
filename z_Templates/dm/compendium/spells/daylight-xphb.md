# Daylight
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*3rd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 hour

For the duration, sunlight spreads from a point within range and fills a 60-foot-radius Sphere. The sunlight's area is [Bright Light](rules/variant-rules/bright-light-xphb.md) and sheds [Dim Light](rules/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) for an additional 60 feet.

Alternatively, you cast the spell on an object that isn't being worn or carried, causing the sunlight to fill a 60-foot Emanation originating from that object. Covering that object with something opaque, such as a bowl or helm, blocks the sunlight.

If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of [Darkness](rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md) created by a spell of level 3 or lower, that other spell is dispelled.
