*2nd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of spiderweb)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You conjure a mass of sticky webbing at a point within range. The webs fill a 20-foot Cube there for the duration. The webs are [Difficult Terrain](rules/variant-rules/difficult-terrain-xphb.md), and the area within them is [Lightly Obscured](rules/variant-rules/lightly-obscured-xphb.md).

If the webs aren't anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.

The first time a creature enters the webs on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the [Restrained](rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition while in the webs or until it breaks free.

A creature [Restrained](rules/conditions.md#Restrained) by the webs can take an action to make a Strength ([Athletics](rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer [Restrained](rules/conditions.md#Restrained).

The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot Cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing `2d4` Fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.
