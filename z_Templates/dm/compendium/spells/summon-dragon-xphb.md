# Summon Dragon
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*5th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (an object with the image of a dragon engraved on it worth 500+ GP)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You call forth a Dragon spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range and uses the Draconic Spirit stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 [Hit Points](rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) or when the spell ends.

The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, the creature shares your [Initiative](rules/variant-rules/initiative-xphb.md) count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the [Dodge](rules/actions.md#Dodge) action and uses its movement to avoid danger.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** Use the spell slot's level for the spell's level in the stat block.

**Classes**: [Wizard](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md); [Sorcerer](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Sorcerer (Draconic Sorcery)](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer-xphb-draconic-sorcery-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Druid](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md)
