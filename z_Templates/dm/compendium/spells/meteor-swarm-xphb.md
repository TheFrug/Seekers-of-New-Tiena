Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points you can see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius Sphere centered on each of those points makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `20d6` Fire damage and `20d6` Bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery Sphere is affected only once.

A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area, and the object starts [Burning](compendium/traps-hazards/burning-xphb.md) if it's flammable.

**Classes**: [Wizard](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md); [Wizard (Evoker)](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard-xphb-evoker-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Sorcerer](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Bard](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md)
