# Enlarge/Reduce
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

For the duration, the spell enlarges or reduces a creature or an object you can see within range (see the chosen effect below). A targeted object must be neither worn nor carried. If the target is an unwilling creature, it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the spell has no effect.

Everything that a targeted creature is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item it drops returns to normal size at once. A thrown weapon or piece of ammunition returns to normal size immediately after it hits or misses a target.

## Enlarge

The target's size increases by one category—from Medium to Large, for example. The target also has [Advantage](rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's attacks with its enlarged weapons or Unarmed Strikes deal an extra `1d4` damage on a hit.

## Reduce

The target's size decreases by one category—from Medium to Small, for example. The target also has [Disadvantage](rules/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's attacks with its reduced weapons or Unarmed Strikes deal `1d4` less damage on a hit (this can't reduce the damage below 1).
