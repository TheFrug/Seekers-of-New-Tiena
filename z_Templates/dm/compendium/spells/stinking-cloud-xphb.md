# Stinking Cloud
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*3rd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a rotten egg)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a 20-foot-radius Sphere of yellow, nauseating gas centered on a point within range. The cloud is [Heavily Obscured](rules/variant-rules/heavily-obscured-xphb.md). The cloud lingers in the air for the duration or until a strong wind (such as the one created by [Gust of Wind](compendium/spells/gust-of-wind-xphb.md)) disperses it.

Each creature that starts its turn in the Sphere must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have the [Poisoned](rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition until the end of the current turn. While [Poisoned](rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) in this way, the creature can't take an action or a [Bonus Action](rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md).

**Classes**: [Wizard](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md); [Druid (Circle of the Land)](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-druid-xphb-circle-of-the-land-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Sorcerer](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Warlock (Fiend Patron)](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-warlock-xphb-fiend-patron-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Bard (College of Lore)](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-bard-xphb-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB")
