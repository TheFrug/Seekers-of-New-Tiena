- **Duration:** 1 hour

One creature you can see within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. It does so with [Advantage](rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) if you or your allies are fighting it. On a failed save, the target has the [Charmed](rules/conditions.md#Charmed) condition until the spell ends or until you or your allies damage it. The [Charmed](rules/conditions.md#Charmed) creature is Friendly to you. When the spell ends, the target knows it was [Charmed](rules/conditions.md#Charmed) by you.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 4.

**Classes**: [Wizard](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md); [Warlock](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-warlock.md); [Sorcerer](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Sorcerer (Draconic Sorcery)](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer-xphb-draconic-sorcery-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Druid](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md)
