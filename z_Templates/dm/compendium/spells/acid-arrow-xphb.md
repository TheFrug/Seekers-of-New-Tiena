%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*2nd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (powdered rhubarb leaf)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes `4d4` Acid damage and `2d4` Acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage only.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage (both initial and later) increases by `1d4` for each spell slot level above 2.

**Classes**: [Wizard](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md); [Wizard (Evoker)](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard-xphb-evoker-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Bard (College of Lore)](compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-bard-xphb-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB")
