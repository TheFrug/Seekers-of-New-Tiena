# Pact of the Chain
*Source: SRD 5.2 and the Free Rules (2024)*  
You learn the [Find Familiar](compendium/spells/find-familiar-xphb.md) spell and can cast it as a [Magic](rules/actions.md#Magic) action without expending a spell slot.

When you cast the spell, you choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: [Imp](compendium/bestiary/fiend/imp-xmm.md), [Pseudodragon](compendium/bestiary/dragon/pseudodragon-xmm.md), [Quasit](compendium/bestiary/fiend/quasit-xmm.md), [Skeleton](compendium/bestiary/undead/skeleton-xmm.md), [Slaad Tadpole](compendium/bestiary/aberration/slaad-tadpole-xmm.md), [Sphinx of Wonder](compendium/bestiary/celestial/sphinx-of-wonder-xmm.md), [Sprite](compendium/bestiary/fey/sprite-xmm.md), or [Venomous Snake](compendium/bestiary/beast/venomous-snake-xmm.md) (see appendix B for the familiar's stat block).

Additionally, when you take the [Attack](rules/actions.md#Attack) action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its [Reaction](rules/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md).
