# Gift of the Depths
*Source: the Free Rules (2024)*  
**Prerequisite**: 5th Warlock
You can breathe underwater, and you gain a [Swim Speed](rules/variant-rules/swim-speed-xphb.md) equal to your [Speed](rules/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md).

You can also cast [Water Breathing](compendium/spells/water-breathing-xphb.md) once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast it in this way again when you finish a [Long Rest](rules/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb.md).
