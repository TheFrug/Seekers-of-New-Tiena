# Bugbear Warrior
*Source: SRD 5.2 and the Free Rules (2024)*  

Bugbear warriors serve those who offer them treasure, food, or the chance to hunt challenging prey.

## Bugbears

*Lurking Goblinoid Brutes*

- **Habitat.** Forest, Grassland, Planar (Feywild), Underdark  
- **Treasure.** Armaments, Individual  

Bugbears embody fear of the wilds and the menace of natural places. They're notoriously stealthy, and foes that venture into their territories often vanish without a trace.
