# Bearded Devil
*Source: SRD 5.2*  

## Bearded Devil

*Devil of Force and Intimidation*

- **Habitat.** Planar (Nine Hells)  
- **Treasure.** Armaments  

Bearded devils, also known as barbazus, fill the legions of the Nine Hells. These cruel soldiers follow the orders of diabolical generals as they defend infernal realms, invade Material Plane worlds, and clash against demons in planes-spanning conflicts.

Left to their own devices, bearded devils encourage mortals to act callously and abuse their power, inflating their egos and inspiring petty tyrannies. Villains aligned with the Nine Hells call on bearded devils to serve as guardians, enforce their will, or fight in wicked armies.

Bearded devils' eponymous beards consist of grotesque, tentacle-like growths. These squirming, barb-riddled beards carry poison capable of preventing magical healing. Bearded devils are also known for their distinctive glaives, through which they channel hellish energy. Those struck by these unnatural weapons suffer infernal wounds that grow worse until stanched or magically healed.

## Traits

***Magic Resistance.*** The devil has [Advantage](rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The devil makes one Beard attack and one Infernal Glaive attack.

***Beard.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* `+5`, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 7 (`1d8 + 3`) Piercing damage, and the target has the [Poisoned](rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition until the start of the devil's next turn. Until this poison ends, the target can't regain [Hit Points](rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md).

***Infernal Glaive.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* `+5`, reach 10 ft. *Hit:* 8 (`1d10 + 3`) Slashing damage. If the target is a creature and doesn't already have an infernal wound, it is subjected to the following effect. *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 12. *Failure:* The target receives an infernal wound. While wounded, the target loses 5 (`1d10`) [Hit Points](rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) at the start of each of its turns. The wound closes after 1 minute, after a spell restores [Hit Points](rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) to the target, or after the target or a creature within 5 feet of it takes an action to stanch the wound, doing so by succeeding on a DC 12 Wisdom ([Medicine](rules/skills.md#Medicine)) check.
