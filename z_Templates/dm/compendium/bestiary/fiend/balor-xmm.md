# Balor
*Source: SRD 5.2*  

## Balor

*Demon of Overwhelming Rage*

- **Habitat.** Planar (Abyss)  
- **Treasure.** Armaments  

Balors embody demons' ruinous fury and hatred. Towering, winged terrors, these demonic warlords seethe with wrath, their rage erupting in waves of fire and as a pair of vicious weapons: a sword of crackling lightning and a whip of lashing flames. A balor's fury persists until the moment of its demise, at which point it explodesâ€”a last act of vengeance against those who slew it. Demon lords and evil gods harness balors' rage by making balors commanders of armies or guardians of grave secrets.
