# Minotaur of Baphomet
*Source: SRD 5.2 and the Free Rules (2024)*  

## Minotaur of Baphomet

*Berserker of the Demon Lord of Beasts*

- **Habitat.** Underdark  
- **Treasure.** Armaments  

Baphomet, Demon Lord of Beasts, claims to have created minotaurs and demands their worship. While most minotaurs live free of the demon lord's bonds, those that serve him become minotaurs of Baphomet. These brutes resemble the hulking, horned demon lord more than others of their kind, and they wreak havoc in that foul immortal's name. Rarely, non-minotaurs cursed by magic-users or spiteful deities might transform into these monsters.

Minotaurs of Baphomet often dwell in mazes, leading their allies to hidden destinations and stalking trespassers. Roll on or choose a result from the Minotaur Mazes table to inspire the shape of a minotaur's dwelling.
