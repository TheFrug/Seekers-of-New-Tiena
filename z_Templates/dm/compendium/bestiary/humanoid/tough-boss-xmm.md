# Tough Boss
*Source: SRD 5.2 and the Free Rules (2024)*  

Tough bosses leverage their street smarts, brawling prowess, and reputation to compel others to follow their demands.

## Toughs

*Brawlers and Bullies*

- **Habitat.** Any  
- **Treasure.** Armaments  

Bodyguards, belligerents, and laborers, toughs rely on their physical strength to intimidate foes. They might be brawny criminals, rowdy tavern goers, seasoned workers, or anyone who uses their muscle to get what they want.
