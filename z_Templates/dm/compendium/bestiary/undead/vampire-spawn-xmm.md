# Vampire Spawn
*Source: SRD 5.2*  

Vampire spawn are newly created vampires. They have yet to fully master their abilities, and many are consumed by their thirst for blood. Vampire spawn might serve more powerful vampires or pursue their own depraved agendas.

## Vampires

*Blood-Sucking Lords of the Night*

- **Habitat.** Underdark, Urban  
- **Treasure.** Any  

Vampires disguise their accursed, immortal natures, passing as mortals to feed on the blood of the living. While the youngest vampires might be little more than bloodthirsty servants of their creators, the eldest possess incredible cunning and control over supernatural forces of the night.

Undead vampires lie dormant during the day, retreating to resting places hidden from foes and the sun's searing rays. Roll on or choose a result from the Vampire Resting Places table to inspire a vampire's grim sanctuary.

### Vampire Lairs

Vampires and vampire umbral lords create sanctuaries apart from the living, whether hidden in cosmopolitan cities or sequestered in ruins where they dwelled in life.

***Vampire Weakness.*** The vampire has these weaknesses:

- **Forbiddance.** The vampire can't enter a residence without an invitation from an occupant.  
- **Running Water.** The vampire takes 20 Acid damage if it ends its turn in running water.  
- **Stake to the Heart.** The vampire is destroyed if a weapon that deals Piercing damage is driven into the vampire's heart while the vampire has the [Incapacitated](rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) condition.  
- **Sunlight.** The vampire takes 20 Radiant damage if it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has [Disadvantage](rules/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on attack rolls and ability checks.  

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The vampire makes two Claw attacks and uses Bite.

***Claw.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* `+6`, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 8 (`2d4 + 3`) Slashing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it has the [Grappled](rules/conditions.md#Grappled) condition (escape DC 13) from one of two claws.

***Bite.*** *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 14, one creature within 5 feet that is willing or that has the [Grappled](rules/conditions.md#Grappled), [Incapacitated](rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated), or [Restrained](rules/conditions.md#Restrained) condition. *Failure:* 5 (`1d4 + 3`) Piercing damage plus 10 (`3d6`) Necrotic damage. The target's [Hit Point](rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) maximum decreases by an amount equal to the Necrotic damage taken, and the vampire regains [Hit Points](rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) equal to that amount.
