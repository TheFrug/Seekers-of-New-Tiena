# Swarm of Bats
*Source: SRD 5.2 and the Free Rules (2024)*  

## Animals

Use these stat blocks to represent the creatures they're named for or other similar creatures. For example, the [Panther](compendium/bestiary/beast/panther-xmm.md) stat block can also represent a mountain lion, while the [Giant Goat](compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-goat-xmm.md) stat block might represent a buffalo. Any of these stat blocks might also serve as fantastical animals with distinctive names and cosmetic details unique to your D&D adventures.

## Actions

***Bites.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* `+4`, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 5 (`2d4`) Piercing damage, or 2 (`1d4`) Piercing damage if the swarm is [Bloodied](rules/variant-rules/bloodied-xphb.md).
