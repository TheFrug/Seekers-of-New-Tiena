## Animals

Use these stat blocks to represent the creatures they're named for or other similar creatures. For example, the [Panther](compendium/bestiary/beast/panther-xmm.md) stat block can also represent a mountain lion, while the [Giant Goat](compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-goat-xmm.md) stat block might represent a buffalo. Any of these stat blocks might also serve as fantastical animals with distinctive names and cosmetic details unique to your D&D adventures.

## Traits

***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny raven. The swarm can't regain [Hit Points](rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) or gain [Temporary Hit Points](rules/variant-rules/temporary-hit-points-xphb.md).

## Actions

***Beaks.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* `+4`, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 5 (`1d6 + 2`) Piercing damage, or 2 (`1d4`) Piercing damage if the swarm is [Bloodied](rules/variant-rules/bloodied-xphb.md).

***Cacophony (Recharge 6).*** *Wisdom Saving Throw:* DC 10, one creature in the swarm's space. *Failure:* The target has the [Deafened](rules/conditions.md#Deafened) condition until the start of the swarm's next turn. While [Deafened](rules/conditions.md#Deafened), the target also has [Disadvantage](rules/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on ability checks and attack rolls.
