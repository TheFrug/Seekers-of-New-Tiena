# Swarm of Piranhas
*Source: SRD 5.2 and the Free Rules (2024)*  

## Animals

Use these stat blocks to represent the creatures they're named for or other similar creatures. For example, the [Panther](compendium/bestiary/beast/panther-xmm.md) stat block can also represent a mountain lion, while the [Giant Goat](compendium/bestiary/beast/giant-goat-xmm.md) stat block might represent a buffalo. Any of these stat blocks might also serve as fantastical animals with distinctive names and cosmetic details unique to your D&D adventures.

## Traits

***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny piranha. The swarm can't regain [Hit Points](rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) or gain [Temporary Hit Points](rules/variant-rules/temporary-hit-points-xphb.md).

***Water Breathing.*** The swarm can breathe only underwater.

## Actions

***Bites.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* `+5` (with [Advantage](rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) if the target doesn't have all its [Hit Points](rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md)), reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 8 (`2d4 + 3`) Piercing damage, or 5 (`1d4 + 3`) Piercing damage if the swarm is [Bloodied](rules/variant-rules/bloodied-xphb.md).
