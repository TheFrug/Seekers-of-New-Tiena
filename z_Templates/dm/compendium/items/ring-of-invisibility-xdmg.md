# Ring of Invisibility
*Legendary (requires attunement)*  


While wearing this ring, you can take a [Magic](rules/actions.md#Magic) action to give yourself the [Invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) condition. You remain [Invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) until the ring is removed or until you take a [Bonus Action](rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md) to become visible again.
