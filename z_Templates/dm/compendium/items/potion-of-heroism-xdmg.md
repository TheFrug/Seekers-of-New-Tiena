# Potion of Heroism
*Potion, rare*  

- **Weight**: 0.5 lbs.

When you drink this potion, you gain 10 [Temporary Hit Points](rules/variant-rules/temporary-hit-points-xphb.md) that last for 1 hour. For the same duration, you are under the effect of the [Bless](compendium/spells/bless-xphb.md) spell (no [Concentration](rules/conditions.md#Concentration) required).
