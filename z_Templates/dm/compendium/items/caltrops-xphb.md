# Caltrops
*Adventuring gear*  

- **Cost**: 1 gp
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

As a [Utilize](rules/actions.md#Utilize) action, you can spread Caltrops from their bag to cover a 5-foot-square area within 5 feet of yourself. A creature that enters this area for the first time on a turn must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 1 Piercing damage and have its [Speed](rules/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md) reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn. It takes 10 minutes to recover the Caltrops.
