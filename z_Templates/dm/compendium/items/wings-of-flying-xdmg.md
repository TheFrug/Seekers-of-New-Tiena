# Wings of Flying
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  


While wearing this cloak, you can take a [Magic](rules/actions.md#Magic) action to turn the cloak into a pair of wings on your back. The wings lasts for 1 hour or until you end the effect early as a [Magic](rules/actions.md#Magic) action. The wings give you a [Fly Speed](rules/variant-rules/fly-speed-xphb.md) of 60 feet. If you are aloft when the wings disappear, you fall. When the wings disappear, you can't use them again for `1d12` hours.
