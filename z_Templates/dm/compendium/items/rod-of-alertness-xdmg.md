# Rod of Alertness
*Very rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This rod has the following properties.

## Alertness

While holding the rod, you have [Advantage](rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on Wisdom ([Perception](rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks and on [Initiative](rules/variant-rules/initiative-xphb.md) rolls. Spells. While holding the rod, you can cast the following spells from it:

- [Detect Evil and Good](compendium/spells/detect-evil-and-good-xphb.md)  
- [Detect Magic](compendium/spells/detect-magic-xphb.md)  
- [Detect Poison and Disease](compendium/spells/detect-poison-and-disease-xphb.md)  
- [See Invisibility](compendium/spells/see-invisibility-xphb.md)  

## Protective Aura

As a [Magic](rules/actions.md#Magic) action, you can plant the haft end of the rod in the ground, whereupon the rod's head sheds [Bright Light](rules/variant-rules/bright-light-xphb.md) in a 60-foot radius and [Dim Light](rules/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) for an additional 60 feet. While in that [Bright Light](rules/variant-rules/bright-light-xphb.md), you and your allies gain a +1 bonus to [Armor Class](rules/variant-rules/armor-class-xphb.md) and saving throws and can sense the location of any [Invisible](rules/conditions.md#Invisible) creature that is also in the [Bright Light](rules/variant-rules/bright-light-xphb.md).

The rod's head stops glowing and the effect ends after 10 minutes or when a creature takes a [Magic](rules/actions.md#Magic) action to pull the rod from the ground. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.
