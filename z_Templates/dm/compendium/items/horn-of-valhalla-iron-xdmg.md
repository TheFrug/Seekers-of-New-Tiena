# Horn of Valhalla, Iron
*Wondrous item, legendary*  


You can take a [Magic](rules/actions.md#Magic) action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the plane of Ysgard appear in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you. Each spirit uses the [Berserker](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/berserker-xmm.md) stat block and returns to Ysgard after 1 hour or when it drops to 0 [Hit Points](rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md). The spirits look like living, breathing warriors, and they have [Immunity](rules/variant-rules/immunity-xphb.md) to the [Charmed](rules/conditions.md#Charmed) and [Frightened](rules/conditions.md#Frightened) conditions. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

A iron horn summons 5 [Berserkers](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/berserker-xmm.md). To use the iron horn, you must have [Proficiency](rules/variant-rules/proficiency-xphb.md) with all Martial weapons.

If you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned [Berserkers](compendium/bestiary/humanoid/berserker-xmm.md) attack you. If you meet the requirement, they are [Friendly](rules/variant-rules/friendly-attitude-xphb.md) to you and your allies and follow your commands.
