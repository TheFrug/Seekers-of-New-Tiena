A Climber's Kit includes boot tips, gloves, pitons, and a harness. As a [Utilize](rules/actions.md#Utilize) action, you can use the Climber's Kit to anchor yourself; when you do, you can't fall more than 25 feet from the anchor point, and you can't move more than 25 feet from there without undoing the anchor as a [Bonus Action](rules/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md).
