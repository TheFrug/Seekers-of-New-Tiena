# Rod of Rulership
*Rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

You can take a [Magic](rules/actions.md#Magic) action to present the rod and command obedience from each creature of your choice that you can see within 120 feet of yourself. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the [Charmed](rules/conditions.md#Charmed) condition for 8 hours. While [Charmed](rules/conditions.md#Charmed) in this way, the creature regards you as its trusted leader. If harmed by you or your allies or commanded to do something contrary to its nature, a target ceases to be [Charmed](rules/conditions.md#Charmed) in this way. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.
