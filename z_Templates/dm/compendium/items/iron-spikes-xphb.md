# Iron Spikes
*Adventuring gear*  

- **Cost**: 1 gp
- **Weight**: 5.0 lbs.

Iron Spikes come in bundles of ten. As a [Utilize](rules/actions.md#Utilize) action, you can use a blunt object, such as a [Light Hammer](compendium/items/light-hammer-xphb.md), to hammer a spike into wood, earth, or a similar material. You can do so to jam a door shut or to then tie a [Rope](compendium/items/rope-xphb.md) or [Chain](compendium/items/chain-xphb.md) to the Spike.
