# Feather Token, Tree
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  


This object looks like a feather.

You must be outdoors to use this token. You can take a [Magic](rules/actions.md#Magic) action to touch it to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree springs into existence. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius.
